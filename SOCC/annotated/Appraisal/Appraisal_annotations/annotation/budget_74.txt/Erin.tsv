#Text=Simpson just wrote this on September 8: 'Now that the Conservatives have brought the deficit down to a small amount - they wrongly assert the budget is balanced, but it is not, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer has reported' The lies that Simpson writes and the Globe encourages and the commenters repeat is unbelievable.
