Donald J. Trump is now confirmed elected POTUS by overwhelming electoral votes majority. Also, Republican candidates have won BOTH Senate and House. He also gets to nominate the vacated Supreme Court judge, bringing the Court to his side as well. The Donald is de facto elected Dictator of the U.S.A. He can do as he pleases. Given his style, he WILL do as he pleases. The Donald won despite having NO support from the entire political Establishment, NO support from Big Media, NO support from Big Money, NO support from the War Machine, NO this and NO that. His opponent used the most dirty of tricks, cast him as friend of 'evil' Putin, which he just smile. See, the Donald being the ultimate outsider knows a whole lot the big political machine that ran America for so long does not know. Chief among this is he is on his way to wipe out both the Democrat and Republican parties at the same time!The Donald ran a movement. Hillary ran a rig to construct a dynasty. In a movement it does not matter about the details. You just have to sound right and look right for the mob to follow. Hillary humiliating defeat is entirely by herself. Trump rise to power is completely the result of the failure of not only both parties but presidents since Reagan. One of whom is a war criminal under state protection. With both political parties wiped out, the first shot of the movement already yields a political revolution. The 'swamp' already half drained. His task now is to be a Revolutionary Leader. Turn everything upside down. He will do well to read up on such people in history. Such as George Washington, Napoleon, Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Mussolini, and yes Putin. Putin saved Russia. Will Trump save America? So his opponent accusation is right after all, just in the wrong way.
