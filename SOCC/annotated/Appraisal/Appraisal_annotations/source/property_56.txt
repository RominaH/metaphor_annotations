Let's be frank. What we need is an infrastructure tax. It's no secret the cities that draw the most immigrants are mired in gridlock and over crowded transit systems. And as JT plans to increase the yearly quota with inadequate investment in our largest cities' infrastructures, maybe a head tax is just what we need.
