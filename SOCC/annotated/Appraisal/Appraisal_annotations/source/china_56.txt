The US thumbed its nose at the International Court of Justice's judgement back in 1986 when the Court ruled against the US and awarded reparations to Nicaragua. All five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have never accepted a ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration/the international tribunal regarding UN Convention of the Law of the Sea for decades. Other countries have also repeatedly ignored the same tribunal's decision when it suited their purposes. Why did the US, Australia and Japan tell China to accept the PCA's ruling now?By the way, the PCA in The Hague is not backed by the UN. Only the ICJ is the key legislative institution of the UN.
