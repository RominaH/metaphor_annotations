If we are talking local problems, it should be noted that he Walloon s refuse to learn Flemish in order to be more marketable and remain mired in their delusional view that being geographically and to an extent culturally close to France makes them superior. The Flemish, good business people that the are, have risen from farmers to become the leading economic force in this country. First, they all speak French, and English and thus hold all the good jobs (not unlike the Quebeckers in Canada who all speak English and thus hold jobs that require one to be bilingual - which the English speaking population of Canada cannot do). In the end, the Flemish are resentful that they have to support the Walloons. Also, please note that Flemish is NOT a dialect, it is a southern variant of the Dutch language, like Serbian and Croatian, Castile Spanish versus Latin American Spanish etc. Fact checking please before asserting such things. Thank you.
