Lots of opposition to publicly-subsidized daycare here. But most of it just seems to be an emotional reaction to the cost, without looking at the economic benefits. More people in the work force to pay taxes, more disposable income to help spur the economy. It's an idea whose time has come (in fact, it came long ago, but no politician had the guts to suggest it). Too bad business has been so persuasive at convincing governments and the citizenry that social programmes are a waste of money while subsidizing business and loosening regulatory oversight is a noble enterprise.
