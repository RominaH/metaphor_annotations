Has anyone considered the immigrant investor program as a head tax. Let the government have your money for a period of time with no interest. Just like a tax. I am tired of our governments apologizing for the beliefs ( right or wrong in our current opinion) of a past generation. Go back in time and see how the voters placed their ballots !
