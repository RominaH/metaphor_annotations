I suspect that a lot of the people who are suggesting that we throw the doors open would be talking out the other side of their mouths, if they had purchased licenses, assuming that they actually mean something. That is not to say that we shouldn't allow Uber, but just that we need to be fair to the people who played by the existing rules. If we are going to throw open the market, they need to be compensated.
