There were KKK members who voted for Trump. There were Maoists and Stalinists who voted for Clinton. Did sex play a role. Sure. Some people voted for Hillary just because she was a women. Some people voted against her just because she was a woman. In depth analysis has just begun but my guess is that Trump won because all the people outside the cities are disenfranchised and wanted their voice heard and Hillary did not speak to them. A woman will be president when she fits the voice of the electorate. Hillary did not lose because she was a woman. Hillary lost because she was Hillary.
