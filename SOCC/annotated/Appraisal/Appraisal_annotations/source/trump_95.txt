This American and world wide catastrophe is a golden opportunity to Canada. If we'll be smart and fast enough to seize this opportunity, we should open our borders to millions of wealthy, educated and liberal Americans who share our values and language and wish to immigrate to Canada. It might be an 'once in a lifetime' opportunity for us to add millions of great new Canadians to our country, boost our economy and add knowledge, intellect and greatness to our great country. And these new immigrants won't need any of our resources for smoothly settling here. On the contrary, they will bring along with them both human and financial wealth that we'll all benefit from. I hope our leadership realizes this historical opportunity and will act accordingly.
