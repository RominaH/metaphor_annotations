The Pope is the Bishop of Rome - the head of the Roman Catholic church. Are you surprised that his views mirror those of the Catholic Church? Hmmm. People like the Pope because he is authentic in his faith and lives his values. He isn't fake. Catholics and especially non-catholics see this as 'refreshing'. The fact that his values reflect his mission to serve the forgotten, poor, abused, marginalized and disenfranchised resonates across many faiths.
