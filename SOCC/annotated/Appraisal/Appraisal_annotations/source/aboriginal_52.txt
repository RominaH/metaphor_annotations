This is a good article , well written . It mentions ' persistent abuse and neglect ' - so who is doing the abusing and neglecting ? Surely the victim's own family and relatives are the most likely suspects ? There are many factors , of course , but the ' culture ' that has developed in many , if not most , reserves is the major problem . They are hotbeds of crime , corruption , and despair . All those who can should get out and join the real world!
