A big change between 2008 and 2015 - that no one seems to willing to talk about - is the increase of overall debt level at all 3 levels of govt. As per recent CGA magazine, before 2008 that level was at about 63%, and now it's about 85%, a 20 point jump. Note that we live in a time of 'historically lowest interest rates'. Which means that debt service payments are about to jump as soon as USA starts raising their rates. This can't continue forever - the indebtedness trend must be reversed.
