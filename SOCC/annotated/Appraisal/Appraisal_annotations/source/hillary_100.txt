There is something inherently sexist about the assumption that women are incorruptible and naturally groomed to be better leaders than their male counterparts by virtue of being female. It is troubling to see intelligent sexist women relay the disturbingly substandard notion that despite Hillary Clinton's deeply flawed and frankly troubling history, this one here must be revered at all cost. Women are equal under the law, and as such should be held to the same legal, ethical, and job performance standards - regardless of their gender or power.
