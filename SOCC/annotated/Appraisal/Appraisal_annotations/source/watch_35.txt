David, don't assume that those who criticize create nothing. As for cynicism there is far too little of it around these days. If the Apple watch was a "better mousetrap" then I would concede it's merit however it does nothing that their other devices don't do and needs an IPhone to use. And, Thomas Toronto, I would greatly prefer it if there were no need for unions however we all know what that leads to and it ain't fair treatment of workers. Galbraith coined a term called "countervailing power" to avoid the consequences of a vacuum and unions are but one example.
