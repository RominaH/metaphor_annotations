@DennisCasaccio, So what do you base your decision on? You have not seen one in person, nor touched one. And you most likely do not know anyone who has. But even reading the marketing materials from the various manufactures reveals that there are differences. Will people find them useful and compelling? Time will tell. But to pronounce judgement at this point in time is nothing but pure bluster.
