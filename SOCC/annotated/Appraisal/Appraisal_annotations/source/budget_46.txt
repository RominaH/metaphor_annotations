I was neither fooled or surprised, and in fact had been posting on these boards that just such a surplus would be announced for months now. That doesn't change the fact that we're moving in the right direction. A small surplus vs. a small deficit might be rather inconsequential from an economic perspective right now, but a small deficit today will turn into a BIG deficit in the not-too-distant future when the global economy weakens again. Going by historic economic cycles right now the world is near the peak of the current cycle, despite what some politicians might try to convince you of. That means that right now is the time to be paying down some nominal debt. The 'good times', such as they are, aren't going to last. Globally the economy is likely to weaken again in probably about 2 or 3 years time. When that happens deficits will become inevitable, but at least if we've been paying down some debt we'll be in good shape to weather the storm.
