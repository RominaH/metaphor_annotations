Fact: The Conservative federal debt in 2008-09 = $457.6-billion.Fact: The expected Conservative debt in 2014-15 = $616.0-billion.Fact: 24% of the total accumulated debt since Confederation was amassed under Stephen Harper. This is not a surprise surplus. It is a political surplus and not a meaningful one as it only represents .7% of Canada's economy. It would take 80 years of $2 billion surprise surpluses to pay down Harper's contribution to the national debt. That doesn't account for the interest payments and doesn't consider that he only achieved one surplus in 7 years. That would mean we need 560 years of Harper 'protecting our economy' to pay down his portion of the national debt.
