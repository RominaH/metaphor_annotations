Budget surplus; budget deficit, it really doesn't matter. In absolute value, the amounts are insignificant compared to the overall budget and if we've been paying attention, we should all know by now what Harper and his thugs have done to create the current economic situation. If you like it and trust them, God help you but go ahead and vote for them. If you regard them as a bunch of incompetents who perfectly embody the Peter Principle, then vote for somebody else. But whoever you choose to support, please don't allow your choice to be influenced at all by budget surplus vs deficit.
