Professor Burton mistakenly stated the tribunal in The Hague is UN-backed, it is not. The Permanent Court of Arbitration (or the tribunal) bears no relationship with UN. The PCA is not the International Court of Justice (the PCA is not a court in the traditional sense; it is only a special tribunal). The ICJ is the judicial organ of the United Nations. A lot of people thought the PCA is the same as the ICJ. Due to the confusion, the United Nations was forced to clarify four weeks ago that the tribunal is not UN's legislative institution and the ICJ 'has had no involvement' in the South China Sea case. The PCA bears no relationship with the UN.US, UK, France and Russia, all permanent members of the UN Security Council have routinely rejected the PCA' ruling for the past 20 years. I do not think its ruling is binding.
