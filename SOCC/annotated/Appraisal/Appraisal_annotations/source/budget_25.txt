Don't worry, Mr. Simpson -- we're not fooled or surprised. You'd have to be a real piece of Samsonite to swallow the government's 'whoa, look what we just found that proves what awesome fiscal managers we are' line. People who were surprised by this surplus news are the type of people who really do believe the car salesman when he says he's going into the back to 'talk to the boss.'I can't decide whether to be insulted that the Conservatives think we're dumb enough to believe this surplus was achieved by actual good bookkeeping, or disappointed that this is the best they can do in terms of originality. But then I have to remember I'm not the target audience for this 'great news.'So, what's next? Seem kind of national emergency that shows how Harper is a hero to the common man? Just want to know if I have time to grab some Raisin ets and a large pop before the next big scene.
