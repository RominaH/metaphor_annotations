It will be a curious time in 4 years from now: voters in the Midwest who elected Trump will be forced to accept that the jobs did not come back, the US manufacturing sector cannot be revived on populist rehtoric, that the economy will have shrunk badly since 2016, inflation will be at decade-high levels, interest rates will be rising, and the only real choice to stop the nightmare is to elect a far-left democratic candidate who makes Clinton look like a Republican. But i do wish them all the best with their choice.
