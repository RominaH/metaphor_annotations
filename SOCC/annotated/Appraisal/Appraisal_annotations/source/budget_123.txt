You are right - the point being that we do not develop our God given resources, we like the quick profit, so we sell them. So we sold Inco, world's largest nickel producer, sold Alcan, sold Falconbridge, sold Nexen and a hole list of oil and gas companies - we are good at selling the farms, not the produce. and nobody has facilitated that more than Mr. Harper. So how do you develop your God given resources when when you sell them as soon as there are willing buyers! You do not seem to like democracy which has proven over and over again that it is essential for widespread wealth creation.
