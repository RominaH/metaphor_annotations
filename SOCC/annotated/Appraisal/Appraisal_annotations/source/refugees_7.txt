'What future do refugees have without proper language training, Canadian education or Canadian work experience?'Like all previous waves of immigrants/refugees - find low paid entry level service jobs - drive a cab, clean buildings, manual labour etc, etc. All this moaning about subsidized day care and the high cost of tuition! Sounds like a case of excessive entitlement and unduly raised expectations.
