It's racist to think the 15% tax is aimed at the Chinese. It's aimed at all those non-Canadian residents but its interesting that one particular group keeps trying to compare it to the head tax, why is that? Are the being racist? Maybe a Canadian of Chinese heritage wrote the legislation....who knows....so quit the whining. I got an idea, let's track RE data better and we can use better facts in our arguments...until then, quit being racist.
