Re.: RCMP. Most people who apply for the RCMP or other police come from groups that have a long history of police work. For most of the new types of immigrants, police work is seen as not the type of work you want your kid to do. At home the police was distrusted, corrupt, the enemy. For the more educated, well off immigrants, it is too low status.
