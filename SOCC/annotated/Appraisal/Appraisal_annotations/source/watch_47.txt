I got a watch for graduation 35+ years ago. No sooner did I put it on than the strap broke. I put it away intending to get a new strap. Five years later I got around to getting a strap. It was 15 minutes later the battery went dead. So I have worn a watch for about 15 minutes of my life. Oddly I seem to always know what time it is, give or take 10 minutes. It can be a pitch black overcast night and the wife will ask what time it is, I go 'its quarter after two' she goes to the kitchen and it is 10 after. I don't use an alarm clock, don't wear a watch, yet somehow I sense the time of day. Then as Nebuly said, there are clocks everywhere when it gets down to a matter of a few minutes. Anywhere where things are time sensitive there are clocks around.
