If the Pope is cautious on indicating a favourable disposition on ordaining women as priests, he might want to look at Anglicanism's experience. The Church of England earlier this year began ordaining women as bishops, and the Archbishop of Canterbury has stated that within ten years fifty percent of the dioceses will be headed by women. They have been ordaining women as priests for twenty years now, along with other Provinces of the Anglican Communion, and now the number of women in theological colleges preparing for ordination are well outnumbering men. The result being that men are leaving the church in droves. In addition to this women are getting all the senior appointments, and come from a background of, in many cases, militant feminism. One group in the UK recently advocating scrapping, fifty percent of the time, the linguistic maleness of Jesus and replacing it with feminist imagery.
