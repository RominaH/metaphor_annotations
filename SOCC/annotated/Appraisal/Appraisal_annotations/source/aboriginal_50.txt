The one word that stood out to me in this and one I was glad was included was NEGLECT. Kids having kids. Poverty is maintained when families are not waiting to be grown, educated and employed before starting a family. A culture of Non-interference whereby the kids are basically left alone without the most basic of expectations and routines is the place to start. It can't be done or even suggested by the non-aboriginal community however for obvious reasons. So we wait.. and the cycle continues.
