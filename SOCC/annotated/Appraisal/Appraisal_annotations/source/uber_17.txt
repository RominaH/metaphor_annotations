Canada simply loves cartels, from milk to cheese to poultry to taxis to telecommunications, the list is endless. And this lack of competition not only hurts all citizens but in the end it severely damages our competitiveness in the global economy by constantly putting us behind the 8 ball. Toronto should do as Santiago Chile did in the 80's, and that is to open up the taxi market by stripping the government red tape for licenses and making it much cheaper and easier for those who want to drive. At first there was a predictable explosion of taxis on the streets in Santiago, but over a relatively short period of time the market itself dictated the amount of taxis that would survive. In other words, the free market found its natural and proper equilibrium. Uber is too good a service to ignore, it's here to stay. So let's be smart and not restrict it for the sake of protecting some tired old dinosaurs.
