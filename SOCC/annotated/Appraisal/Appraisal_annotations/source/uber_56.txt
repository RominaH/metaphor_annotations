Licences (and milk quotas, etc.) should never have been allowed to be sold on a secondary market. We need a solution but it likely will fall short of full compensation for the capital cost of plates that lead to high fares. Perhaps a transfer of fees from plate less drivers to plate owners for a limited number of years. Perhaps whatever courts rule when the certain lawsuits are settled.
