I suppose that Mr Trump's victory against the 'Establishment' is a much milder version of the French revolution. Of course, the US revolution will not employ the violent excesses - guillotine etc. - but wholesale changes of the governing class are coming. Mr Trump is a free man, unshackled to traditional convention with presumably the support of the House, Senate and Supreme Court to enact his mandate. Indeed, we live in interesting times.
