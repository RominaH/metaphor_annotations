All parties play accounting tricks to make the numbers look better. The crazy thing about the Ontario Liberals, and I suspect federal, is that their numbers look horrible even after a massage and then they try and pull a 'stupid pet trick' by telling us the numbers look great. It's like calling a plane crash a thing of beauty.
