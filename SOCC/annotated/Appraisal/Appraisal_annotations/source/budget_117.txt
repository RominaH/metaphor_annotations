Where's the conspiracy?Budgets are ALWAYS (at every level of government, from nearly every government in the world, attributable to parties on every end of the spectrum) a worst-case scenario. Not only do you get a buffer in case something goes wrong (ie: oil prices), but when things go better than expected you can publicly pat yourself on the back. The more I think about it, this isn't even remotely shady on Harper's part any more than it is politics as usual.
