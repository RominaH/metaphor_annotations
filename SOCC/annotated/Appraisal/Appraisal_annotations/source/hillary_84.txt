She actually lost by so few votes that you can say she lost for virtually ANY reason. She was a woman. She wasn't black. She wasn't Bernie. She wasn't affable. Polls gave her a high enough lead that supporters didn't show up to vote. You name it, it may have given her enough votes to win. However, from my reading of it, being female had little to do with it. For my part I think its just as much a case of Obama failure as anything. That 'hope and change' really didn't materialize. But the US is highly divided. You can see that in the voting patterns of citizens initiatives. In Maine virtually every citizen initiative was divided almost fifty fifty. Want legal marijuana? Just barely over half do. A bond initiative for public transportation? DItto. Increased taxes for public education, 51%. Its not a coincidence that virtually every presidential election is decided within 8 percentage points, and thats no matter WHO runs. But I have to say, I do a lot of volunteer work, and most of the heavy lifting is done by women. From my experience, the next generation of women does not get its motivations or its role models from elections. And personally I think thats a good thing.
