Europe is NOT failing refugees, it has accepted hundreds of thousands! They are being expected to do too much. Instead of continually trying to depose Assad, the West should be trying to stabilise Syria and its neighbouring countries so that Syrians can begin to go home. The millions of refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey cannot be held there in camps forever and neither can they all be absorbed around the world. More refugees need to be accepted but Syria and its neighbours need to be fixed too.
