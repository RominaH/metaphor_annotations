I think Marie Heinen has misinterpreted the phrase Michelle Obama used in her outstanding speech about the value of women. In 'going high when they go low' we do not become one of 'them' - the knife holders for example, but we stay true to ourselves in treating others as we would be treated. If you want something to say to your daughters listen to Michelle's speech. Women and men, girls and boys who refuse to participate in destroying others to gain power over others, but who act and think with the belief in equality and respect between ourselves.
