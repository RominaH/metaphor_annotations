I want regulated drivers who must meet a standard of competence, personal reliability, and reputation driving regulated vehicles that must be clean and well maintained. I don't want anyone who does not comply with driver and vehicle standards to offer a transportation service. I want to be able to put a child in a vehicle, send them off to a destination and feel safe. THAT is the litmus test. If you think that's unrealistic, you are not making reasonable demands of the system. Will it be expensive? Sure.
