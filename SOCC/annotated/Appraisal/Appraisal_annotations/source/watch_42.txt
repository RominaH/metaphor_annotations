I bought an Apple II computer in 1980. The tech geeks at the time panned it. When the MAcintosh was introduced in 1984 it was panned, as inferior to the more adaptable MSDOS system. When the iPod was introduced it was panned as inferior to MP3. The iPad was panned as unnecessary. The first iPhone was panned. Was there ever an apple product that was not panned when first introduced? The fact is that most technological innovations take off and transform our ways of doing things in ways the critics always fail to anticipate. That's why they are critics and not inventors and transformers of human culture. That said, the main potential benefits of i Watch I see are identification, device control and health monitoring. However, a lot of health geeks go to great lengths to reduce microwave and EMF exposure, so wearing an emitter of microwaves and EMF on the body all the time would be problematic.
