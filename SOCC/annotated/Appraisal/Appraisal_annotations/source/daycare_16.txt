The author knows the odds against the NDP gaining power next year are about as high as the odds against Putin winning the Nobel Peace Prize. The NDP is reverting to its traditional role, which historically was to promote big-ticket social programs and hope they would gain sufficient public support to be adopted and enacted by the Liberal party. Much of Canada's social progress has relied on this dynamic. However, provincial governments are likely far more jaded at this stage. The cost-sharing model on which medicare was established, for instance, was fairly swiftly abandoned by the federal government, leaving provinces increasingly holding the bag for health care funding, which now eats up about fifty percent of provincial revenues in some jurisdictions. Even Martin's belated reforms, temporarily continued by Harper, barely restored a fraction of the funding losses the provinces have endured. Why would the province's agree to another bait-and-switch scheme? My guess is that the chance all ten can be brought on board is somewhere between nil and zero.
