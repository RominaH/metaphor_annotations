The only reason I can think of is that the Japanese atoll is kind of middle-of-nowhere in the western Pacific, while the Spratly Islands are smack in the middle of the busiest sea-lanes in the region, with about five competing territorial claims.... If nothing else, your reference also got me to read about Rockall, where the UK foregoes any claim to an economic exclusion zone. Seems like this could be a useful example for others....
