Foreigners have no right to purchase whatever they want in Canada. Anyone who is not a permanent resident by definition should not need to purchase a home. They can rent. This is all about storing wealth and making money flipping homes. The BC Government has now stopped a big business that foreigners were making in BC and the foreigners do not like losing this business. Homes are not to be treated like blocks of gold to be stuffed in the deposit boxes of foreigners. They are needed for people to live in.
