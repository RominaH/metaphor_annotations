Everything Harper has done from DAY 1 has, and continues to be a shell-game! You'd think that even die hard CON supporters would have tired of the endless lies and deceit by now. Obviously those who still support Harper revel in and profit from the dictatorial like mis-government of a once great Canada under the leadership for a select few! That is not what the Fathers of Confederation envisioned when it was founded. Without Truth, Honour, Integrity and Security being espoused by any PM (regardless of Party) for ALL Canadians, we are merely a fake democracy!
