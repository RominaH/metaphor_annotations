If you find yourself thinking that the choice is Uber is because it is the cheapest alternative, then you are as bad a money g rubber as the taxi companies that you like to slag. The cost of roads is based on our equal use of them. When someone turns their access to a commercial venture then they have to pay extra through commercial licenses. Uber is not paying for the use of our roads.
