Several days ago we outlined the path from Trump's victory. It was going to be via Florida, North Carolina and -- one of -- Michigan or Pennsylvania or Minnesota / New Hampshire. The latter were the lower probability. Pennsylvania was his best bet. And it was indeed, it was a three way horse race on Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Hampshire - after Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio were in Trump's column. Minnesota and New Hampshire stay blue by the slightest of margins. I don't know if Trump did run the 'coal miner' radio ads in Pennsylvania, which has no advance voting - which means it's all on the day - but there was unmistakeable mid-West discontent. The Globe had no idea what they were talking about - they should be paying us to write commentary on here. Not a single writer provided accurate analysis on this election. You had lost your objectivity.
