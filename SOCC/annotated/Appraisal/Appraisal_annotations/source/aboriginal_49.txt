The last report on abuse of aboriginal women that I read indicated that some 80% of physical (and sexual) abuse of young aboriginal women was committed by aboriginal men, mostly family members. Unless the aboriginal community leaders deal with this abuse themselves, with direct assistance from relevant law enforcement agencies, nothing will change.
