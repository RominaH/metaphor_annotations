I'll admit I sometimes look at my son's iPhone and think 'Yeah, that'd be nice.' Or I'm at a meeting and everyone's whipping out their tablets to look something up. For now I'm fine with what I've got, and it's more a question of not having time to learn something new, rather than a disinclination to do it. I suspect that within a year or so I'll have a tablet, and when it's time to renew the cellphone plan I'll probably get a smartphone of some kind. Guess I better do it before my son's off to university. . . .
