We have multiple generations where aboriginal children were removed from their families and institutionalized. The youngest of this generation are in their 40's. We have institutionalized the welfare state on these northern reserves and there is no quick fix solution. There is now an ingrained distrust of governments and their institutions. The best solution will be education and again that will take generations before we see the full effect of that effort.
