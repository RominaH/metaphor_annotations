'What are you going to tell your daughters?'We are going to tell them that plenty of other countries in the world have elected female leaders, prime ministers, and presidents. Some of them even 'third world countries'.We are going to tell them that being female is no guarantee that they will succeed, or get the top job. We are going to tell them, when they run for election, their gender is no guarantee of winning or losing. And we are going to tell them that the most qualified person does not always get the the elected position. Or the job. And we are going to tell our sons the exact same thing.
