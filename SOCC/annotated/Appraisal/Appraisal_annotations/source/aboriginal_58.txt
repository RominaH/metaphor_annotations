Unfortunately, Stephen 'I couldn't care less' Harper doesn't believe this is a matter of a'sociological phenomenon'. In his cut-and-dried, right wing world where there are no grey areas, the only thing to do is turn the matter over to the police after the tragedy has occurred. The idea of preventing the tragedy doesn't even enter into his mind. He's much too busy concentrating on more ways to increase corporate profit margins. People don't matter.
