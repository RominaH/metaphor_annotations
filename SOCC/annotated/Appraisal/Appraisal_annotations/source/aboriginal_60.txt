We don't need a national enquiry - we need disclosure of the data - which the authorities already have ! Then we need a national strategy to deal with the problem. This strategy should consider how many murders - say in the last ten years . How many murders were solved ? How many victims were aboriginal & how many victims were non aboriginal ? Of the solved murders , how many killers were aboriginal ? How many non aboriginal ? How many aboriginals were killed by other aboriginals ? How many victims , of the total , were women ? How many were aboriginal women ? All this is already known by the authorities . They need a strategy to deal with it.
