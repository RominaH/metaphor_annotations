Turpel-Lafond has presented the problems...however, it's time to move along with her non-subtstantiated suggestion that these problems are the result of 'colonialization.' Until Aboriginal leaders (and I am speaking of more than Chiefs) start pony ing up and accepting responsibility, then these sad situation will persist.....If there is an inquiry, then Aboriginal leadership may not like the results.....
