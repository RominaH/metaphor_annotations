I think DSR raises a valid concern. I can see Canada becoming hyper regional under proportional representation. AB and SK and interior BC form a voting block. Ontario stands alone and votes Liberal. Quebec has their own interest. The Maritimes elect the Increase the Dole party. Nothing would ever get done. Canada exists because we're forced to compromise between the main parties and those parties have to form big tents of various regional interests. That'd be the case no more under prop rep.
