It's stuff like this that propels Donald Trump (and let's face it, Rob Ford) into power. People are tired of being called sexist just because (an extremely flawed) woman doesn't win. They're tired of being called racist, xenophobic, trans phobic and Islamophobic at every turn to justify progressive outcomes that 'ought to have been'.Donald Trump won fair and square. You may not like the outcome, but it has nothing to do with identity politics except that the distaste for identity politics is what bred the movement that supports him.
