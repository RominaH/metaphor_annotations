In my view, the failure of Hillary to win was nothing to do with gender, but all to do with the failure of the Democratic Party to look after the working class of America. Thomas Frank points out that Bill Clinton promised much to this group and then proceeded to sign NAFTA, which disadvantaged them. Similarly Bill and Hillary shifted welfare payments to the poor from the Fed Govt to the states, with disadvantage for those voters. He also suggests that another woman, Elizabeth Warren, would have done much better for the working classes and the poor; and Bernie Sanders might have obtained similarly high levels of support, eating into Trump's group of supporters.
