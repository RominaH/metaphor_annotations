Here we go again with one of the left's favorite hobbies - race baiting.  Any inquiry will point directly to the First Nations' community and all of it own faults.   But, but the evil white man is to blame for all the world's ills right?Meanwhile, our so-called journalists have completely ignored another officer involved shooting that occurred on August 11th.  In Salt Lake City, the same day Michael Brown was gunned down a black policeman (whose name is still withheld) shot and killed an unarmed 20 year old white person.  The dead man, Dillon Taylor, like Michael Brown, had a criminal record, was unarmed and was trying to run from police before surrendering and being shot dead.Golly gee, how come ALMOST NO ONE is reporting this?  Where are the marchers, rioters,looters and wall-to-wall media coverage?  Oh right, this story does not fit the MSM mythical racial fairy tale.http://www.wnd.com/2014/08/black-cop-kills-white-man-media-hide-race/
