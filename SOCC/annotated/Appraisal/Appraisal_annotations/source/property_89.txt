The tax applies to all foreign money so isn't the same as the Head tax. But let's not kid ourselves. BC does have a shameful history of racism. The head tax, the race riots of 1907, the internment of Japanese Canadians (a Federal decision hugely influenced by BC politicians) - followed by the restriction of Japanese Canadians from returning (and even voting) until 1948. It's also pretty fair to say that there is a component of racism in the criticisms of rising housing prices with all Chinese being painted by the same brush. Read some of the comments in stories about BC real estate to see examples - it's pretty overt from certain posters. Even the CRA's lame excuse that they didn't want to be accused of racism by doing their jobs is pathetic - reverse racism. (Note: I don't believe this excuse for a second. CRA was just incompetent and lazy and are now using 'race' as an excuse).
