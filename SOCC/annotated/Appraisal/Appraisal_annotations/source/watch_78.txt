The human capacity for invention has defined us and the world we live in for hundreds of thousands of years. Technology is the one thing that has given humans the ability to dominate the planet as we have. And it's only accelerated since the invention of agriculture, industry, information technology. I don' know what the exact period of a cycle is, but there appears to be a geometric progression to the increase in pace. Like it or not, technology is the thing that is our greatest strength and weakness. Technology has give us the ability to live in any ecological niche in the world, travel to any point on the globe, to decipher the mysteries of creation (to a great extent), master the very building blocks of life (genetics), explore other planets (and stars one day), communicate instantly with anyone anywhere, etc, etc. It's also endangering life on earth through climate change, led to the invention of nuclear weapons, caused epidemic levels of heart disease and cancer, etc, etc. But what're you gonna do? We're an inventive, technology-using species. The challenge is navigating it, but lamenting it will do no good.
