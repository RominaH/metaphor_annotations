I 'see' people from outside Canada, whereever they may come from. I live in Vancouver, work in tech, and come from a culturally diverse family (Asia, Europe, 400 year roots in Quebec). Some action was necessary. The financialization (is that a word, sadly yes) of residences and holding them as an asset class has had many negative impacts.
