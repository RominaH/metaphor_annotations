human are strange animal!they hate taxi. they don't appreciate Uber. an empty word 'thank you' or 'I'll rate you a 5-star' cannot bring food to table. that's Hippocratic, not an appreciation. If you really appreciate, tip drivers for good service. only idiots believe tip is included at the cheap and dirty rate at $0.90/mile
