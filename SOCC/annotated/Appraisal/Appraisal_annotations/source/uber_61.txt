Most drivers do not own the taxi plate ....they lease the car from the car owner...who either owns the plate....or rents the plate from the plate owner. Drivers also must pay for fuel....dispatch fees...and many times...have to pay a fee for CC machines, and each transaction .At the end of the day/night shift, after paying for all the added on costs.....the actual driver keeps only a fraction of what the meter reads....Uber....is as safe as any other taxi..but they don't pay all those added on costs that the cab companies' drivers must pay
