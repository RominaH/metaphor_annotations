This American remembers history and a lot of his fellow countrymen do it. Firstly, it has taken us almost eight years to climb back from the worst recession since the Great Depression. Speaking of which, we've had one other businessman as President albeit a decent man. That man was Herbert Hoover. I pray for no repeat of the economic mess of that era.
