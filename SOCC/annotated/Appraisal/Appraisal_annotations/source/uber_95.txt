Uber is great, especially the 'surge' pricing. Why get into a cab with an actual licensed and insured driver, when you can get into a private car, driven by someone without a background check, with only the minimum insurance, and at best, a sketchy knowledge of where to go, or a out of date GPS. Lost something in an Uber car? good luck tracking it, it's gone. Why stop at taxis?How about Uber lawyers, Uber Doctors, Uber Pharmacists, etc. Why have regulated pricing, when the market can decide!
