What a stupid article. Of course the budget has 2 parts- revenues and expenses. You still need to be a careful steward w both to balance. You still have to manage revenues w smart tax policies. Corp and personal taxes were reduced to help bring about the fast recovery from the recession, fastest in the g7 for job growth in fact, so they can't just be disregarded. Maybe the author needs to understand tax cuts can actually increase tax revenue through more economic activity. The lefty media still twisting themselves in knots to make a surplus into a bad thing.
