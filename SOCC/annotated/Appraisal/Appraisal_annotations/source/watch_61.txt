It's a good thing you got a iPod my friend. Any other manufactured player would have died years ago. So Apple has provided you with a great player and now you upset? The only this that is really obsolete is your way of thinking. Please don't take that the wrong way Nebuly , it's a fast moving tech world and a lot of new products have come along and just like the Walkman the iPod Classic has had its day. Be happy and you will live longer and thanks for supporting Apple 8 years ago.
