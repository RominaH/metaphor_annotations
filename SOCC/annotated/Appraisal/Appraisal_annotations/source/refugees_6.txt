'More than 1,000 of the newcomers are living in temporary housing. And we still have a shortage of family doctors, a lack of proper dental care for low-income adults and a lack of subsidized daycare spaces for parents...'Meanwhile, by some estimates 200, 000 Canadian are either homeless or insecurely housed. And hundreds of thousands more pay in excess of 50% of the income on rent and are a paycheque away from eviction. There is no right to housing in Canada for Canadians. Why should there be such a right for others? As for medical care, millions of Canadians lack a family doctor and millions of low-income Canadians have no access to affordable dental care. And daycare availability is spotty, to say the least. The author appears to lack perspective. Canada is in the bottom third of OECD countries in social program spending calculated as a percentage of GDP. It's not a very generous country to its own disadvantaged citizens. Sorry, but that's the way it is.
