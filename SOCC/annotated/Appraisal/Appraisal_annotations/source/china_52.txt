Teddy Roosevelt instructed the admiral of the U.S. naval force sitting outside Manila Bay to be prepared to blow up the Spanish navy sitting in the harbour. With the sinking of the battleship Maine in harbour (it was likely an accident) the order went out to destroy the Spanish naval force in the Philippines , which was accomplished in one hour - without the loss of life of one American seaman. Then Teddy resigned his position as under-secretary, formed up his Roughriders cavalry unit and rode up San Juan Hill. The rest is history........which you should really read in depth sometime. MM . McKinley was more for shooting at.
