This editorial is pretty much similar to the Guardian's editorial this morning. Funny how that is. While some points made are valid concerns about Trump, both editorials glaringly neglect to mention Hillary Clinton's egregious faults. The fact that the Democratic party sold out it's base support during the primaries - it's corruption exposed is probably reason enough that they lost. Notwithstanding the fact that Clinton's stated platform of a no fly zone over Syria was going to lead to war with Russia had me breathing a sigh of relief this morning.
