Why are we afraid of a reopening of the NAFTA?Climate change and North American responses, allocation of water and other natural resources, technology now available that was not even thought of in the 40 year old agreement must now be something that would be addressed with respect to a review/renewal. They have a greater population and greater financial resources, however, Canada had come a long way in establishing ourselves with respect to leading in the world and I think we should not be afraid of new and enhanced opportunities.
