Looks like Canadians are all worried and scared. The best part of all this is that President Trump will be cleaning the floor with PM junior. Canadians better get used to meeting their treaty obligations that they have been shirking and ignoring for years like NATO obligations that Canada signed. NAFTA being ripped up pretty soon unless Canadian sponge rs pay their bills.
