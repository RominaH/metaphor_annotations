I great intelligent and funny read by the author once again, but I think she exceeded her own high standards this time. Loved her writing...Unfortunately, it seems to get lost on most posters who only see this as a great chance to pile on Apple as if Apple is the only one who does this. She could have written about many companies and achieved the same goal. It's not about Apple people - it's about us. Blinded by the hate I suppose...
