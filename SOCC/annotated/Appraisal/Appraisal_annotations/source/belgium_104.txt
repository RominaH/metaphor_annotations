Too many drinkers of Uncle Obama and western 'koolaide' to have any real perspective on what's going on in Iraq and Syria. ISIS is a 'walk in the park' compared to an all out war between Sunni-Shia factions. ISIS is merely a symptom of a far greater regional struggle that has been festering for decades. When buffoons like our former PM blast the only stable government out of Libya and then run away to let ISIS take control....you know the west is way out of its collective and intelligence league, in even having a strategy outside of the coalition of the confused!
