The Smart Watch will help people with blood pressure and heart ailments to monitor their vital signs but, unfortunately for the rest of us, it wont cure Ms. Renzetti's myopia. Ms. Renzetti uses a Blackberry. Perhaps she can remember back to 'the good old days' before mobile phones were invented when she used a land line. She wouldn't have seen the need or use for mobile phones either. Ms. Renzetti doesn't need to change the thermostat from across the room but a person with mobility issues and living alone would find it a blessing. The new LED light bulbs will replace incandescent bulbs not because 'invention is the mother of necessity' but because the 'necessity is the mother of invention'. The bulbs reduce power consumption by over 85% saving all of us big $$$, including Ms. Renzetti.
