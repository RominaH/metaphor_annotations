While the situation is tragic, I object to the use of statistics with no context as a way of over-dramatizing the situation. 'Over 1,000 aboriginal women have been murdered' writes the author. Over what time period? If one goes back far enough, I imagine one could get that number to exceed 1,000,000. Of course, one might have to go back several centuries. The number is meaningless without the time period. As for the root cause, is it too simplistic to suggest that the cultures of the Aboriginal people in Canada are dysfunctional and that some of that responsibility has to lie with the Aboriginals themselves?
