Your editorial hints at this, but it should be made explicit:the major component of the price to a customer of taking a licensed cab in Toronto is that of paying a large rent on the taxi licence plate attached to the car. Remove that unnecessary and costly restriction and the price to the public can be reduced significantly, as well as supply increased. Improved customer service and convenience also follow. It's a win-win for customers, and also for public transit for that matter since taxi service is considered to be part of public transit.
