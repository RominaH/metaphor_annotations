Yes, there is misery in the Middle East. It will only get better when those who run stay home and fight it. If the default option is always 'The West', the refugee crisis will see no end. The intersection of tribal boundaries, family blood feuds, a Sunni-Shia hate divide that worships killing, and, arms merchants ready to arm anything with a Toyota pick-up and a million bucks, ensures that it continues. The refugee response in the West is merely moving the problem around and we should not feel guilty for opting out of it.
