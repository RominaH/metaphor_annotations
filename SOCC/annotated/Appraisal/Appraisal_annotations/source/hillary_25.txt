Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Maggie Thatcher, Angela Merkel, Benazir Bhutto, and more have made it happen. A couple in South America. We even had one, however briefly, here in Canada. Clinton did not win the presidency because she was perceived by the people to be deeply flawed. It had nothing to do with her gender; the Americans would have loved to have a female President!Get over your victimhood.
