1) China does not allow foreign ownership of it's properties, so why is there a double standard when it comes to Canadians having to tolerate Chinese ownership of ours??2) Why is it Canada's responsibility to accommodate the Chinese? The Chinese government has created a hostile environment both in terms of politics and human rights. The majority of Chinese want to leave the country, which is not equal nor free. So why has Canada been tasked with the responsibility as a safe haven for Chinese nationals, and their money, at the expense of Canadians, Canadian tax payers, and the quality of our lives?3) The Citizens of Vancouver and of Canada, in general, are what gives these properties their value. We are a fair and equal society where human rights and the rule of law rein. We are not bogged down by corruption, government suppression nor a vast indifference to each other. We have dialogue and free speech, open government and democratic institutions, and an enormous acceptance and healthy curiosity for what is different. Our behaviour gives these properties value! This country is not at war with another country nor itself. Why should the citizens who built and are building this country be put at a disadvantage, in terms of finance and quality of life, to accommodate those who have little to nothing to do with this city or country. Personally, I don't think my behaviour and my actions should put me at a disadvantage to promote the inability of Chinese nationals to reform their country. 4) If a foreign entity eg. state, business, or individual were to impose their ideologies on another, or exacerbate the inequality in that country the term colonialism would be used to describe their actions. Then why shouldn't their be some means to correct this? 5) Unlike the Head-tax, this tax does not target any one nationality.
