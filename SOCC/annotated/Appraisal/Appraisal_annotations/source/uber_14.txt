But how do you know the brakes work? Is there a safety shield in place to protect the driver? People can have multiple identities so the driver never really knows who they're picking up. I find a lot of the support for Uber to be naive. The people who run Uber are not your friends. They want their drivers to earn as little as they can get away with and they want to skim as much money as possible -- while doing basically nothing. We need more rideshare services that are owned by the drivers, or someone needs to create an open source uber.
