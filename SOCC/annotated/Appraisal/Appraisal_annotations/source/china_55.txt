The U.S. refused to recognize Canada's internal waterway the Northwest Passage sovereignty. It challenged Canada claim by sailing war ships and subs through the Passage without notifying Canada. Just like any waters in the world it claims dominance. So be very careful about the Yanks. And not be stupid supporting its hegemony as the writer of this article clearly do.Canada and U.S. are allies in mutual defense. That's quite OK. But mutual defense DOES NOT mean we get dragged into it global wars of power and dominance. This is called the Pierre Trudeau Doctrine. The basis for Canada refusal to join in America war of ideology and hegemony in Vietnam, war of profit, power and religion in Iraq. Obama, a Nobel Peace Prize holder (but not winner), is responsible for initiating two potential global wars of the 21st century - new Cold War with Russia, War with China. It's all about power and profit. The Pentagon even commissioned a study by the Rand Corporation on how to fight a war with China, report just released. U.S. government sees China rise and activities in the S. China Sea as a direct challenge to its claimed global hegemony. There is some truth to it. American Navy currently can block all sea traffic on the Malacca Strait to chock off China. It has stationed forces in Singapore. China response to this threat is part of settling the borders on the South China Sea. A settlement to its favor is to enable China to defend the Malacca Strait blockage. If it works, America claim of global dominance will have a big limp cut off. Now what is Canada going to do with America challenge to our NWP sovereignty. Cry and beg? No, build a fleet of Arctic Offshore Patrol Boats, lightly armed, to act as surveillance and intruder trigger. There is only one force the U.S. empire mongers understand - Force.
