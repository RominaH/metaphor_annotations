Very well said...and thank you for shouting it from the rooftops. The morning my children and I woke up to the horrible reality of Trump winning, my 14 year-old daughter asked me how it happened how a woman could be hated so much that a racist, sexist bully could be the preferable choice over Ms. Clinton. Barely able to explain it to myself, I struggled to find the words I needed to tell her that her voice, her vote, her existence mattered in the face of such insanity taking place in the U.S. Days later, I'm still trying to find the answer and I appreciate your take on it. If Trump was a protest vote, then clearly Americans chose to protest civility, inclusion, reason, kindness and collaboration. More than ever before in my life (and yes, I was born in the States but have lived here since I was 10), I'm grateful to be a Canadian, but I'm not sure I will ever be able to explain this presidency to my daughter or my two sons. One thing for sure, with strong, intelligent women like you and so many others willing to speak up and lean in, my daughter will have role models to follow. Thank you.
