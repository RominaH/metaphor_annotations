People like this Pope cause he is a genuine guy and he turned the church to focus on the gospels, what Jesus asked Christians to do. He is more aligned with the Baptist movement that moved away from the Catholic church in the 1,500's.It's interesting how some left wing radicals have adopted what he said about capitalism. The Pope talks about unbridled capitalism, not all capitalism. The left wing forget to the 'unbridled' part.
