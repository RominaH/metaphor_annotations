Why do they need to be compensated? Technology has changed the market conditions. When that happens something that once had value might not in the future. If you purchase a house or stock in an oil company, you are not guaranteed its value in perpetuity. These people made a speculative investment and are now trying to suggest it was a guarantee. I don't suspect that the city ever made any guarantees about the value of taxi plates.
