It must be nice to sit back in academia, with benefits and tenure, and debate points in the media. This is very simple, Mr. Professor. Non residents are assessed a tax if they purchase real estate. It applies to Americas, Italians, and the Chinese, that are non residents. What part do you not understand. You are smart. Think about it. Actually, if you are really not too burdened in academia, think about all the Canadians and residents that cannot af fort a place to live in BC. It is not always about you, Professor.
