Here are some other reasons why she may have lost:1. Refused to have press conferences 2. Played tricks to win the nomination in the first place (Sanders should have won)3. Focused on gender (it's about a vision)4. People are tired of the old guard (has it worked for them?)5. No real message: Working together to build a stronger America, same old same old6. Pretending that everything is just fine for everyone, when it clearly isn't7. Wall st. insiderTrump, like Rob Ford, simply said that things are broken, which they are! You can't live in the US on minimum wage, these are the jobs that are left! I am not a Trump supporter, but you have to agree that her candidacy was just about how great she is. But what are you offering to the public, and do they believe you?
