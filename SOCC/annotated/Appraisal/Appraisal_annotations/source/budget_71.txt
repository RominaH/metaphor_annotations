People see what they want to see and believe what they want to believe. The announcement of a budget surplus from the completely untrustworthy Harper administration will not sway all voters, it will merely solidify support in those who already support Harper. What is sad, however, is the brazen manipulation of the truth conducted by Harper in the first place and the fact that anyone at all believes him. 33 days to go and Harper will be gone in any case.
