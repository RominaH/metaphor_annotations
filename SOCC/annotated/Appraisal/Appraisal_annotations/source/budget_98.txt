The question that should be answered by the devious Harper is how, after inheriting in 2006 a $13 billion surplus from the Liberals, he managed to add a further $160 billion to the federal debt?And at the same time rival Tartuffe in hypocrisy by touting himself as a fine economic manager!!While ignoring the mere existence of the provinces, all Harper did in a time of high oil prices was roll the dice on making Canada a petro state. That gamble has crapped out. Harper will be recorded in the still short history of our nation as our worst and most destructive prime minister.
