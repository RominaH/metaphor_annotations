Not sure where you are getting your numbers....as of February 27, 14,383 government sponsored Syrian refugees have arrived in Canada. As of yesterday, 69% have permanent housing. That equals approximately 5000 without permanent housing. No housing, no job skills, language barriers...the program's a mess. As far as I'm concerned, it's time to close OUR borders.
