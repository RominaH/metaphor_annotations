This is quite simple. If Hillary had been a man, we never would have heard of her. The first and most critical step of her political career was marrying Bill Clinton. Even assuming we get past this showstopper consider the treatment of a male who engaged in all of the dodgy activities like she has done. He'd probably still be in prison. As an exercise think of Hillary and her life but as Harry Rodham.
