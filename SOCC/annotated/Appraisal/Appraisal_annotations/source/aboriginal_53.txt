This is absolutely tragic. The call to get premiers to deal with this when natives have stated repeatedly that they don't want us involved in their affairs is not an effective solution. If the natives wish self determination it is certainly and absolutely up to them to resolve this issue. Outsiders have attempted to help in the past with no or poor results. In fact, our society at one time performed experiments on native children. We have also 'taken' children from their home and those results were poor at best. The issue can be resolved at the family level. And that is where the change must start. A warm loving home is certainly preferable to the mean streets of any city. And the streets are mean, even in the most progressive of societies. And if a child is led to believe that the streets are better than home, there is a problem in the home. No amount of hand wringing by government is going to help.
