Richard Roskell: Not ignoring it at all, as I indicated above. Holding constant the emigration of both groups from unstable, hostile, and other dysfunctional environments, my question is this :what variables might be in play to result in the different behaviour of the two groups? Surely poverty and alienation affect the Congolese as much as they do the Moroccans. BTW, I am not defending Christianity and am well aware of its atrocities.
