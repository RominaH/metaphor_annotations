I just love to read comments for readers that are not Apple fans. Making a statement about Apple product that you will never buy is kind of funny in a way. I drive a Honda and a GMC Truck but I never put down a Tesla motors for there electric cars. For Apple users the Apple Watch will save me lots of time over the day. For example I just got a notification alert from my iPhone. If I had the Apple Watch on, I could read the notification and decide if I need to respond to it now or later. If it was a phone call I could take the call or message back that I was tied up. With all the new Apps coming out the things that you will be able to do will be endless. From personal Health to Stock Notices real Apple users will have it all. But go ahead and tell the world what you think, it makes for good entertainment. ;)
