The glass ceiling for women has been shattered around the world long time ago with Thatcher, Merkel and many many others. The fact that the right female candidate has not come along in the US, has nothing to do with 'glass ceiling'. Did the writer cry out about glass ceiling when Sarah Palin was not supported? Palin was not supported for the same reason Clinton was not supported - voters did not find either of them suitable for the job. Accept the result of the election and move on.
