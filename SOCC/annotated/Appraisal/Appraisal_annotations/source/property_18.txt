FYI, the rest of the country does not think the way Molson did a while ago. Is it somehow contemptible that a turban wearing man or an Asian comes to mind when someone thinks of 'foreigner' in Vancouver? Granted Vancouver has many turban wearing men and Asians who were born in Canada or are residents. But if you asked a computer to run through a database of non-resident passport photos and generate a generic face, it'd come up with people from Asia. It's simply reality. There is nothing to be ashamed. Don't let the thought police and the SJWs direct your thoughts with the threat of slander.
