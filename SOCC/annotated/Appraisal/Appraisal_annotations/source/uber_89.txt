They dictate meter rates because, as the article states, they have created an oligopoly and an artificial shortage of taxis. If they didn't dictate prices under the current system, rates would be sky high. What the city needs to get out of is the restriction in the number of taxis and to allow more competition. THAT would help tremendously.
