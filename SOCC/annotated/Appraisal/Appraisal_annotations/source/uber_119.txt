owning a monopoly happens when you have enough politicians bought by your unions and other interest groups. So while the real estate monopoly over sold property information is owned by the MLS, and the liqueur retail monopoly is owned by the LCBO and the cashier's union behind it, the taxi owners didn't have enough politicians bought to reaffirm their monopoly. It's all a matter of degree of corruption. There is no absolutes.
