No, no line in the sand; but one person's 'necessary' is another person's 'don't need it'. I don't necessarily want to 'make do with less'; but I have what I need to do what I want. I have a camera (digital) to take pictures with; a watch to tell me what time it is; a Blackberry that lets me send and receive texts and phone calls. If I want to check e-mail, Facebook, browse the web, Google something, I have a computer. When I'm away from it, I'm at work, or doing something where a computer isn't necessary (like cooking, gardening, reading, watching a DVD). If I have a burning need to find something out Right This Very Second - well, it can usually wait until I'm near a computer. And I'm fine with all that, just as I'm fine with people who absolutely, positively can't live without something that does everything except open the garage door (and I'm sure there's an app for that). So don't judge people who don't have to have the latest i Whatever as hopeless fuddy-duddy stick-in-the-muds who'd go back to wind-up gramophone s if they had a chance (that said, I do have a wind-up gramophone, which my son - born in 1997, and as wired as they come - thinks is wonderful). I edit a weekly newspaper, and use Photoshop and InDesign to put the whole thing together; a long way from the physical lay-out and paste-up I learned with, and I wouldn't go back to those days for all the hot wax in the world.
