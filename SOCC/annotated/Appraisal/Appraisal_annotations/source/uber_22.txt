Given that you can provide and review feedback from other passengers on the driver/car (and vise a versa) provided through Uber it could actually raise the bar. If you're rude to your clients, have a dirty car no one is going to book you - or if they do they know what they are getting ahead of time. Rude to a drive, or mistreat the auto and no one will pick you up. Seems like a better approach to me.
