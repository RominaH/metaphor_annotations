Hardly, the money was never taxed, god knows where it came from. Show us a paper trail as I was required when I was non resident and all will be good. But everybody knows this money is not legal tender in Canada and tax must be paid. I would have CRA investigate every home purchase in canada, add cars as well instead of bothering people like me who have lived and worked for canada ian comp amies all my life in Canada. It would not cost the taxpayers a nickel as there are lots of tax people on the payroll now to make this happen.
