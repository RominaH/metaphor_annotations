Of course gender had something to do with this loss. But it is simplistic to pin the loss on one factor. Clearly a big factor was the electoral vote system itself, as Hilary won the popular vote. Racism, fear of terrorism and violence in the streets, unemployment in the midwest, the anti-choice 'Christian' contingent, distrust of liberal media and political powers, anti-intellectualism, fear of immigration and the big social changes of the last few decades, and the fascist fantasy of the 'strong man' who will fix all your problems, and probably other factors, all likely played a role.
