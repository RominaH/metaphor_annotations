'...whether the federal budget shows a small deficit or a small surplus is almost totally irrelevant.'Lol, nice. So all the liberal fear mongering and hate directed at Harper for a deficit, now doesn't really matter when a surplus is on the books. Who needs a cat and a laser pointer when you have liberal 'logic' to entertain!
