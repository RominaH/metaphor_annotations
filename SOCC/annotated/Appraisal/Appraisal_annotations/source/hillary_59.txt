It's in the nature of elections that they have winners and losers. if a woman is running against a man, sometimes the woman wins and sometimes she loses. A progressive woman has no difficulty embracing progressive women in positions of power. However, the USA is not a progressive society and Hillary Clinton is very definitely NOT a progressive woman. In fact, she is probably the only candidate the Democrats could have nominated who could have lost that election. Elizabeth Warren, to take one example, almost certainly would have produced a different outcome.
