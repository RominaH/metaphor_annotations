I like Francis because he seems to understand and recognize that life is very difficult for the marginal, the disenfranchised and the disadvantaged. He eschews pomp, as much as he can in the gilded cage he now inhabits, and is very different from his stern, aloof, emotionally shut-down, cold, entitled predecessor. He appears comfortable with himself, open, frank, tolerant and kind, yet absolutely firm and strong in the way he is guiding the church into being a less judgmental and incrementally more open and less corrupt institution. How refreshing that he's allowing himself to be empathic, kind, down-to-earth and concerned about humanity, the environment, economic injustice and fairness. If there has to be a Catholic church, better it be lead by Francis. The Pope or Trump? If I could have dinner with one of them, it's Francis, in a heartbeat!
