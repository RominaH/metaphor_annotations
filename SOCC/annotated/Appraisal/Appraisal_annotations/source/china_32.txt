I don't quite understand why American need any allies when their defense budget is more than top xx military spending countries combined. It makes no sense in real war term unless you use it to control those 'allies'. They are totally useless since it is not WW2 time. Chinese think it is quite laughable when American cry for allies in Asia when facing China. It means you're so weak to hide behind someone else. And Chinese understand perfectly none of them can be put to a real fight. Allies are just BS in today's world.
