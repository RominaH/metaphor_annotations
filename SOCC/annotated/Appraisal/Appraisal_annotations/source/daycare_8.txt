In Ontario the criminal Liberal gov't of McGuinty and Wynne introduced All day kindergarten at enormous cost to taxpayers. The results are pretty weak and it does nothing for children as they progress through the inefficient, extremely expensive and union run education system. So we're essentially paying billions for a daycare service already in Ontario. If we really wanted to expand the benefits for working parents, why not extend school hours to 5pm and run schools all year round as many other countries do.? Novel idea having teachers work a full year for a full year's pay, No?
