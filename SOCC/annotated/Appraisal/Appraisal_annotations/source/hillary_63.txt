Let's get real..... women in America voted for who ever they want to and even with the chance to elect a first female President they didn't. They didn't trust her and Americans voted for change and voted against the elitist politicians and all that goes with it. Trump will adjust and the world will go on...... he may do as well as Regan or better. Or ...... he'll be gone in Four years and the next great hope will show up. The American vote was not about an anti women agenda.........relax and due some deep breathing
