I, on the other hand, feel lost when I'm not wearing my watch. I'm not always in front of my computer or in my car or in a room with a clock; sometimes I'm (hard to believe, I know) outside, doing yardwork, or at the local garden centre, or at a friend's house with a clock not readily apparent. Indeed, the last scenario played out a week or so ago, at a meeting, and someone asked what time it was. I glanced at my wrist and had the answer while everyone else was still reaching for their phone.
