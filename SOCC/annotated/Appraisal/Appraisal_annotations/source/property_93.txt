This column reminds me of the history courses I took at UBC: pretty good at summarizing what's already happened, but not particularly helpful or insightful regarding how the past relates to what is going on currently and considerations/impacts for the future. The 'average' person could have come up with this list of questions, but I expect more from an editorial....like maybe an opinion with facts to support?
