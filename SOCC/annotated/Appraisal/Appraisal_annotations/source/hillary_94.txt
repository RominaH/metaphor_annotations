The facts and numbers don't support your argument that Hillary lost because she is a woman. Strange, because as a prominent lawyer these should form the basis of your article. Hillary was clearly defeated not by sexism, but ironically she fell because her candidacy was entrenched and supported by the exact system that most Americans were hoping to reject. Trump did not win - Hillary and her crowd of political elites were shown the door. I can't stand Donald Trump, and would have voted for Hillary if I was American. She and the Democratic Party were blind and ignorant of the rejectionist tide sweeping America. They were snobby elites who made vast (as it turned out) fatal assumptions that Obama voters would stay with Hillary. It is true that women are underrepresented in leadership roles, but strong leaders (who happen to be women) have been elected in many countries including Britain, India, Pakistan, Israel, German, Argentina, Liberia, Denmark, Iceland, Lithuania, (plus five Canadian provinces & 3 Territories).
