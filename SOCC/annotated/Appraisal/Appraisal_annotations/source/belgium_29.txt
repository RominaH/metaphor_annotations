Brussels is home to much of the European Union bureaucracy. As well, Ms. Gagnon quotes a commentator in her article about how much additional government is purely for Belgium: 'there are 19 urban communities, one central government, one parliament and two ‘mini-parliaments,’ one for the Walloon s and one for the Flemings.” And six police forces that don’t work together'. In short, Brussels is the shining light of left-wing big government. And yet all of this government cannot protect its citizens from terrorist attacks. The politicians and bureaucrats will deny responsibility while claiming that they need more money (i.e., higher taxes) to fund improved security. The reality, however, is misplaced priorities and too much money spent by bureaucrats on activities that are unproductive and unimportant. Protecting the safety and security of citizens is arguably the highest priority of a democratic government and that is where government resources should be redirected.
