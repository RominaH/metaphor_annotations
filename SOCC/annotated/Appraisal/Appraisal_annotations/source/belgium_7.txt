@Informed Albertan - I went to your National Post comment, "Dedicated prayer rooms at odds with secular schools" (2011) and I would like to respond: First, this is an article about Ontario provincial policies. The use of "Canada" makes it seem the action is federal but it is provincial; Second, I agree with an excerpt from the article: "Barbara Kay in Montreal: I find it chutzpadik in the extreme for any religious group to ask for a designated space to pray in a secular institution." I have already experienced the stripping of religious artifacts in classrooms years ago, when I lived in Ontario. Although my early years were spent starting the day with the Christian "Lord's Prayer" and celebrating "Christmas," schools I later attended ceased any connection with any religion. Out of respect for the growing diversity of religions emerging in Ontario, only a photograph of the Queen was hung on the walls; no crosses, Bibles, genuflecting, crossing oneself or religious songs remained in the classroom. Why should Islam be excepted and treated differently than Christianity? If religion is left at home, a great deal of social conflict will be avoided.
