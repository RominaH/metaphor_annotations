Great piece. Most Canadians who have been keeping close watch on government decisions and issues over the past year (gee, I wonder what that percentage of Canadians is...15-20%, I suspect, thinking optimistically) weighed in early on this 'surprise' surplus with many 'decreased spending' stories. Now, the details that include the TIMING manipulation as well as the obfuscation of the real reasons for this 'tiny' (yup, that's the word!) surplus, blown all out of proportion. Thanks to Mr. Simpson for his last paragraph, too, about the irresponsibility of the NDP and Liberal candidates for pandering to seniors with the OAS roll-back. This is fiscally nuts. See populationpyramid. net/canada/2015 to see why.
