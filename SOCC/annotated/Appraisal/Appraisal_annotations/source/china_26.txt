China is an angry country with a big chip on its shoulder. It feels it has not been respected and is not being given its proper place in the international order. Add in the fact that China's aging, paranoid rulers use trumped-up nationalism as a way to deflect scrutiny from their own activities and you have a recipe for future conflict. The big danger is that this conflict could go from bellicose talk to actual war and this could easily start from a small incident in the South China Sea.
