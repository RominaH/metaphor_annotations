'This $37-billion in increased revenue did not come from tax-rate increases but from the economy returning to something approximating normal after the slow-growth period following the financial recession of 2008-09.This return to near normalcy, rather than any specific government decisions, flipped the federal budget from post recession deficits to near-balance, and now to surplus.'So, the budget actually balanced itself !!Who was it that said that........?
