It would be better to elect a really good first female president, not a corrupt one with lots of baggage. Also, Clinton represented the status quo and people wanted a change. What really is too bad is that the Democrats in 2008 rejected Hillary for another male. A more energized Clinton without so much baggage would have been more electable especially after Bush. Funny have the Democrats have trouble self-reflecting.
