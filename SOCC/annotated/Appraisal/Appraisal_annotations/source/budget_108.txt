This is a good article by Simpson. I especially like the point he makes that neither of the two main opposition parties are likely to roll back the increase in qualifying age for old age pensions from 65 to 67.While the NDP and the Liberals rose up on their hind legs and howled at the moon in pretentious partisan protest at the time, Harper did the right thing and our old age security is still on par with the best in the world. The opposition knows this and is not likely to roll back the qualifying age, in spite of their histrionics to the contrary. I'm at a loss though about his point about the surplus. Small or not a surplus is a surplus and better $1.9 billion surplus than deficit. And as long as the books weren't fudged, which they weren't (although opposition partisans will try to spin that they were) who cares whether the surplus is due to increased revenues or 'careful economic stewardship'.All political parties, think Chretien and Martin especially, play accounting tricks to their benefit. But like I said, a surplus is a surplus
