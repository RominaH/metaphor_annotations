What a pompous out of touch and whiny editorial ..Thanks to Snowden , Assange , and the spooks at the FBI he won .. Hillary broke down last night - this editorial puts you in her class Try and appreciate the fact that 55 mil PLUS voters picked her - ignoring the advice of the media and the inner circle of crooks ... I see Michael Bloomberg is still telling his shills to babble on .. cnn was hilarious last night as the bozos continued babbling .. Bill Mahr will make jokes but he has become disgusting in his hate ...Wont bother me if 100, 000 abortions used by promiscuous women for birth control end up with the tramps being sterilized .. no one but the holy rollers thinks ALL abortions should be banned - and they wont .Bye bye walmart and the other retailers selling stuff made by slaves .. I am buying made in America from now on ..A few less wars is a step in the right direction..The World has a way of looking after itself - time to try someone new ...
