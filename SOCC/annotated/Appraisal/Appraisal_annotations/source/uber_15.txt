But there IS evidence that Uber is less safe. You only have to Google the number of incidences globally to see this and Uber can wash it's hands of any liability because it is only a booking app and imposes no regulation on its drivers. They can remove themselves if something goes wrong. If the drivers have to start paying license fees and undergo training and be liable under a regulated insurance scheme, then the economics don't work as well. Yes the cab system in Toronto is pathetic with filthy cars and a monopoly but that is an issue of regulation, not competition.
