'Heâ€™s hardly the choice of the establishment, media, cultural, business or political.' Here is the big call out. None of those get to pick the leader in a democracy, the leader be it President, Prime Minister or Premier is picked by the people. I think the big lesson here is for media to be more diligent rather than partisan. If the MSM want's to push an agenda then rather than telling the people who to vote for try being less biased and hold governments to account even your precious PM Justin.
