How is it possible,,, has everyone been hypnotized, The only monopoly I see is that Uber can do as they wish, without consequences currently,,,, Uber drivers are driving without any insurance,, and tax fraud,,, no HST,,, who know if they are even claiming income from it,,, According to the G&M an Uber driver makes a 1000 a week net in a brand new car,,, Really how can the public be so gullible,,,
