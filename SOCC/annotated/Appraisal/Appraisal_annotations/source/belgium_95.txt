There are small accommodations made daily in your town by the civic officials without the media reporting it. E.G. in my town recently they put in glass blocks in a swimming pool area because Muslims didn't want women to be visible from a certain vantage point. One bigger example: remember McGuinty rebuffed an attempt at limited sharia in domestic cases? This is going on every day in small ways in all our communities and it's in the interests of the bureaucrats, i.e. to not make waves that might threaten their positions or pensions, to go along with these request.
