The historic head tax was meant to dissuade ethnic Chinese from coming to and staying in BC. As the BC property transfer tax applies to individuals who are neither Canadian citizens nor permanent residents, it's intent and effect will be to encourage foreigners, Chinese among others, who weren't intending to stay in BC to become permanent residents or citizens. So the intent and effect is the opposite of the head tax.
