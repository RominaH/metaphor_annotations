I live in Quebec, worked in the Social Services.. I have seen how our Que daycare works. All to often it is the ones who could pay more that end up using the daycare system. They actually put their names onto a list for a spot in selected daycare, the minute the mother is expecting. I have even heard of cases of parents who are planning a baby in next two years to get a name on a list. Meanwhile those low income working moms and families have to wait years to have a spot in a daycare. Why, because they are not as aware of 'how to work the system' as the others. People put their kids in daycare, higher income families, sometimes for no other reason to have time to do what they want, they do NOT work.. The concept of daycare is good, but must be better monitored with perhaps slanting pay scale so that the ones for which the idea came to be, can benefit. Not the middle classes who can pay more, but do not, and take up spaces that could be used by those who so need it..
