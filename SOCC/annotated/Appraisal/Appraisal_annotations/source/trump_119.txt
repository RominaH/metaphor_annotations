interesting how the American people rejected Hillary and the status quo. I think this reflects poorly on Obama and the last 8 yrs of democrats. Obama said his legacy will disappear if Trump was elected. Well said Baruk. It is still hard to believe that anyone could vote for Trump. He is one obnoxious egotist, that is for sure. I guess just as it was in Canada in 2015, people just wanted a change for changes sake.
