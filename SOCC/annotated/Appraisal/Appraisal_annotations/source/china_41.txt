Moral relativism is rather useless at his juncture. It's not about what the US has done, it's about what China is doing. The US will not tolerate Chinese Communist expansionism in the South China Sea and it the likelihood of conflict is very real. The US will support the regional nations facing Chinese aggression and this may well lead to an escalating war. It is a dangerous situation and not one that is likely to be solved by diplomacy or international courts.
