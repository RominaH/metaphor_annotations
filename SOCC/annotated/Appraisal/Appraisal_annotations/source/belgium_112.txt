You know, I don't really buy this poor maligned immigrant nonsense. They aren't held in an apartheid. In Beligum, they are given free world class medical care, free education (much more than exists in Canada), social housing, free clothing. What else do they want? At some point we need to wake up. This isn't about some segmented group that needs more cash thrown at it. They received all the benefits of modern welfare society and they still want to kill us. When it was some impoverished farmer in Afghanistan that hated us for drone striking his kids, I could get the left's argument that this drove him to radicalism. These aren't such people in Belgium. They are the people that have been given every possible opportunity by the West, and they still want to kill us due to the indoctrination they receive in their cultural centers and mosques. So I dismiss the author's view that these people are held against their will in some slum without benefits, simply not true. The author is correct that the political and security instability in Belgium allowed radicalism to grow unchecked, but it wasn't for a lack of welfare for these people. What is apparent is if the police are cracking down on radical preachers and community leaders, the terror sponsors will continue to find young men to carry out their acts regardless of the education, health care and money we give them.
