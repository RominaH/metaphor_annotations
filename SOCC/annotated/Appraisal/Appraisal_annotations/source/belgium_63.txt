Ms. Gagnon provides an interesting historical summary of the internal backbiting that goes on in Belgium. Very Canadian like. Suspect other factors are at play here. Political correctness, a permissive criminal justice (Gagnon's reference to illegal weapons) and immigration system, and a blind belief in cultural relativism are all likely significant contributors.
