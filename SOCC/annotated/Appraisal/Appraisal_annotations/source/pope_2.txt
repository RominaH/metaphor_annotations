A good friend who was recruited by a headhunter for a lofty position was offered the following piece of advice: 'Always follow an A-hole'. I.E. it enhances one's reception amongst staff to be a breath of fresh air, relative to the previous leader. I don't say this to diss his predecessors, but Pope Benedict *was* a little over-starched, and as much of a sweet guy as Pope John Paul was, he was clearly more at ease in the formalities of the Church than walking amongst the poor. So, in that respect, it is the perceived contrast between Francis and his predecessors that earns him the enthusiasm he encounters.
