#Text=Besides the fact that Uber has people driving their cars around without insurance, where they really should be getting both $50,000.00 fines for not having insurance and $250,000.00 fine when they attempt to claim that they dont use their car for transporting people when they have an accident, and their obvious tax fraud, both for income tax as well as HST,  I guess they scared the G&M into writing such nonsense,
