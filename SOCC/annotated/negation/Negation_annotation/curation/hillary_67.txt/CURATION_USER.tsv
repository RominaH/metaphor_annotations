#Text=Because her career as a politician is spotty at best (you never heard anything during the campaign about her past achievements other than she held the office) so she could not run on that; her husband is a philanderer and she should have left him in the dust as soon as the Lewinsky affair broke (instead she stayed with the corrupt Bill to continue to forge the power plays that so illuminate their lives); and she was selected by a party which knee capped Bernie Sanders who would have been a far more worthy candidate.
