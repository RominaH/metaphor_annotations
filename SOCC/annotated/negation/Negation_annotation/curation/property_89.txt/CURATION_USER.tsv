#Text=The head tax, the race riots of 1907, the internment of Japanese Canadians (a Federal decision hugely influenced by BC politicians) - followed by the restriction of Japanese Canadians from returning (and even voting) until 1948.It's also pretty fair to say that there is a component of racism in the criticisms of rising housing prices with all Chinese being painted by the same brush.
