#Text=A small surplus vs. a small deficit might be rather inconsequential from an economic perspective right now, but a small deficit today will turn into a BIG deficit in the not-too-distant future when the global economy weakens again.Going by historic economic cycles right now the world is near the peak of the current cycle, despite what some politicians might try to convince you of.
