#Text=After drastic cuts to Veterans Affairs, Immigration (350 million dollars), Aboriginal Affairs, healthcare, the CBC and many other government departments, the fact the budget was balanced in 2014/15 was an afterthought.Thus the question we'll be facing in October; do we want a government that will actually govern and make the hard decisions that are called for in these challenging times, or do we want a Harper government that spends 90% of its time campaigning instead of governing.I for one have seen enough off these far-right Harper Reformers.
