#Text=However, many of these houses are in deplorable condition, because they have never had any care and attention given to them by the homeowner.Some homes on the prairies, were converted Granaries, that were continually modified and expanded as necessary when families grew.One in particular was made into a one room shack,200 sq. ft. that was still in service, and upgraded to 1200 sq. ft. lasted until the year 2000 before it was destroyed by owners who failed to keep it in good repair.Time is long past for Band leaders to get past self service at the expense of all of these young people
