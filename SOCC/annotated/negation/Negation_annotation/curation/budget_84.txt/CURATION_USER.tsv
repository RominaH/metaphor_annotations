#Text=Harper should get zero credit for managing the post-2008 recession because things just naturally rose back up and it had nothing to do with 'economic stewardship' but he should get all the blame for the current recession (albeit by the smallest of margins) and that it must be the result of of his lack of economic stewardship.And of course he is completely to blame for Ontario's problems because I guess 10+ years of McGuinty and Wynne had nothing to do with it.
