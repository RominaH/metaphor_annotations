#Text=Disingenuous because it's not nearly as anguishing or important to be denied the privilege of a vacation home due to frenzied demand/prices, as it is to be denied the possibility to buy a home to raise your growing family in the city where you work; and because U.S. and British buying was not nearly as prolific (not surprisingly, since their populations are much smaller).
