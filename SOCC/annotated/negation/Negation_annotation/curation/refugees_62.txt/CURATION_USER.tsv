#Text=This article is the proof of the statement made by many, that no matter what and how much we do it will never be enough, or appreciated.I would not take a single more refugee from that part of the world, but unfortunately it looks like our naive prime minister and his pandering party are going to make the same mistake that foolish nations like Sweden and Germany have made.Canada's future will not be better.
