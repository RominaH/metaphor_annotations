#Text=Instead of presenting himself as someone who was in charge of the economy and was fully aware of the inevitable results of his policy decisions, he instead sets himself up to have his own ridicule turned around on him.By Harper suggesting that his predicted deficit has now turned into an unexpected surplus opens the door for Justin Trudeau to reinforce and vindicate his oft-maligned statement that budgets really do balance themselves.MrC
