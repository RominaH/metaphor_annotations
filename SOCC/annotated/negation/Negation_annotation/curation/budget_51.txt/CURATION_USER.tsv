#Text=It is almost pointless to comment on this article as the truth of it is so plain and obvious.However, for the benefit of those who do not pay any attention to politics , just keep this in mind: Harper will do anything and say anything to retain power.He is completely shameless.This 'surplus' is just a WORD he has uttered for the sake of effect.There is no proof whatsoever that a genuine surplus exists and even if it did , Harper would spend 100% of it on himself.You would not see one penny of it in any form.
