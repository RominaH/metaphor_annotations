#Text=This cannot be repeated enough: had those who destroyed Iraq in 2003 on false pretenses (non-existent WMD's) been ostracized rather than allowed to continue influencing Washington's policy, Libya and Syria would be unscathed and the world spared not only the growth of ISIS but a refugee crisis now reaching near-biblical proportions.And 'regime change' in Iraq would not have happened without the active complicity of the corporate media.

#Text=Unsurprisingly they peddle a self-serving narrative, whether WMD lies to invade Iraq, a pro-Israel bias to justify its occupation or a collective amnesia on the origins of ISIS.In Canada, media giant Postmedia recently tightened even further its ideological grip by merging the editorial desks of hitherto competing newspapers, even though its purchase of Quebocor was approved by the Competition Bureau on the condition it kept them separate.
