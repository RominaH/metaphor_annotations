#Text=Not only is Bergoglio just the best PR man the Church ever had to spin stories like a politician at election time, he's even managed to hide his dirty linen from the time when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires collaborating with the military dictatorship and not even helping a couple of his own progressive Jesuit priests escape persecution.
