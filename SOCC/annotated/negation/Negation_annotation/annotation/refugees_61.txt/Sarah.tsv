#Text=Europe has adopted a humanitarian response born out of necessity.Canada, on the other hand, selects refugees, after weeks of interviews and examinations, based on whether or not they can be an economic asset to Canada.There is not much humanitarian about Canada's policy re Syria refugees, which is basically an extension of its immigration policy, as far as I can tell.Canada is picking the 'good' ones and leaving the 'bad' ones for Europe.And Canada is simply not taking it's fair share.
