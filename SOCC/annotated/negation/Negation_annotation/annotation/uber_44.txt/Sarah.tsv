#Text=I understand that the taxi system is broken ($100,000+ for a license plate is ludicrous) and for sure needs fixing but suggesting that we drive with total strangers not unlike hitchhiking seems very unsafe for these reasons: 1) taxis are inspected more rigorously, 2) taxis are insured, 3) taxi drivers are safety and CPR trained, 4) taxi drivers must pass a background check .
