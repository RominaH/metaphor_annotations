#Text=Right now Uber is a little too wild west.Otherwise the market will just drive prices down until enough players drop out and the one's with big cashpiles (like Uber who've made their money skirting the rules everyone else has to play by) will consolidate and jack up prices.But mostly it's a safety thing.
