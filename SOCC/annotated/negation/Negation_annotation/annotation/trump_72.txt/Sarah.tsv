#Text=Pennsylvania was his best bet.And it was indeed, it was a three way horse race on Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Hampshire - after Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio were in Trump's column.Minnesota and New Hampshire stay blue by the slightest of margins.I don't know if Trump did run the 'coal miner' radio ads in Pennsylvania, which has no advance voting - which means it's all on the day - but there was unmistakeable mid-West discontent.The Globe had no idea what they were talking about - they should be paying us to write commentary on here.
