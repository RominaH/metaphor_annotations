#Text=No Harper bashing here - it's all been said - but we're left with a more important issue than his personal integrity - what to do about the provinces' finances.Many provinces have yet to make any hard choices, especially here in Ontario where union pay increases all violate the Premier's own line that there will be no more money unless there are commensurate cuts elsewhere.
