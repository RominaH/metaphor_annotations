#Text=Three significant contributors to Trump's victory were: i) alienation of the lower middle class felt with the elitist media propping up the equally elitist politicians ii) the feeling that political correctness has gone so far as to stifle any meaningful, sometimes painful but necessary debate about tough issues and iii) disenfranchisement of many by globalization, excessive legal immigration and uncontrolled illegal immigration.

#Text=Selfie Boy does not have any traction in Washington any more; his left wing policies of globalization, limitless immigration, unlimited government benefits for all, reckless spending and debt accumulation will turn Canada to a banana republic located right next door to an economic giant who perhaps will not build a wall in its northern border but certainly can slap a visa requirement on Canadians to stem the flow of economic migrants and  controlling entry for security reasons.
