#Text=If it's wrong to vote AGAINST someone based on their gender,Then surely it is also wrong to vote FOR someone based on their gender.Yet there were many people advocating openly for people to to do just that.I wonder how many votes Clinton got just because she was a woman.
1-1	0-2	If	
1-2	3-7	it's	
1-3	8-13	wrong	
1-4	14-16	to	
1-5	17-21	vote	
1-6	22-29	AGAINST	
1-7	30-37	someone	
1-8	38-43	based	
1-9	44-46	on	
1-10	47-52	their	
1-11	53-59	gender	
1-12	59-60	,	
1-13	60-64	Then	
1-14	65-71	surely	
1-15	72-74	it	
1-16	75-77	is	
1-17	78-82	also	
1-18	83-88	wrong	
1-19	89-91	to	
1-20	92-96	vote	
1-21	97-100	FOR	
1-22	101-108	someone	
1-23	109-114	based	
1-24	115-117	on	
1-25	118-123	their	
1-26	124-134	gender.Yet	
1-27	135-140	there	
1-28	141-145	were	
1-29	146-150	many	
1-30	151-157	people	
1-31	158-168	advocating	
1-32	169-175	openly	
1-33	176-179	for	
1-34	180-186	people	
1-35	187-189	to	
1-36	190-192	to	
1-37	193-195	do	
1-38	196-200	just	
1-39	201-207	that.I	
1-40	208-214	wonder	
1-41	215-218	how	
1-42	219-223	many	
1-43	224-229	votes	
1-44	230-237	Clinton	
1-45	238-241	got	
1-46	242-246	just	
1-47	247-254	because	
1-48	255-258	she	
1-49	259-262	was	
1-50	263-264	a	
1-51	265-270	woman	
1-52	270-271	.
