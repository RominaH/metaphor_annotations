I agree with her that the problems stem from colonialism - more specifically, residential schools.  The survivors can't parent because they never experienced good parenting.  Plus they're traumatized and poor.  Its complete dysfunction.The solution doesn't lie in decolonizing (not gonna happen) but its good and healing to point out that its not their fault.
