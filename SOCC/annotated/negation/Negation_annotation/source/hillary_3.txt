'If she was a man, she would be president-elect today.'Nonsense. Clinton lost because of her past not because of her gender. You can't have it both ways - the media constantly portrayed her opponent as a buffoon, yet if she couldn't defeat a buffoon it was because of who she is not because of her genitals. There were better women who could have run but the Dems chose Clinton.
