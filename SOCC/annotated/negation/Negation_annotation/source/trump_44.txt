I had a bad night's sleep and weird dreams.My predictions: 1. The US will adopt isolationist politics, which will include Canada and co-opted Mexico, and somewhat distanced relationship with Europe.The US will drop out of NATO. 2. Russia will take back it's old satellite states without opposition. 3. China will take over in Asia.  4. The Middle East will be allowed to run to ruin. 5. I woke up before I got to Africa or South America.The ancient Chinese curse,'May you live in interesting times.' , has been realized.
