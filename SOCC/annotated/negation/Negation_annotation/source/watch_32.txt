But with the latest iPhone or iPad you can check the weather, take pictures, have a FaceTime chat with a loved one in another city (anywhere in the world, really), send and receive email, browse the web, track your BP, play a game while waiting for a bus, look up  a word in a dictionary, check a fact pertinent to a discussion you're having, check how your team is doing in the standings, shop, research your next big purchase, read a PDF, look up a recipe, tune an instrument, translate a phrase into a another language…I could literally go on for a couple days to enumerate the hundreds of thousands of things you can do with a smartphone.Point is: why would you want to make do with less? You know, for most of human history, people couldn't store thousands of songs in a compact device that could play those songs through discrete little earbuds, so why draw the line there? Why draw the line at electricity, plumbing, central heating and air conditioning, automobiles, airplanes, sewage systems, radio, television,… again, I could go on for days.Point is, you appear to have drawn a line in the sand (probably around age 49) and you consider everything that was invented up until that point was 'necessary' and everything after that point was 'excessive'.
