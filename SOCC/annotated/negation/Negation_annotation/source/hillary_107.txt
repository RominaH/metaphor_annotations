To Ms. Henein, we say that this comment (and the full reply found on our site) is our effort to not suffer foolishness quietly. In these desperate times, those with the platform and authority to opine on justice should perhaps consider not only the personal stakes of calling for retrenchment and war.Your article both chastises and laments young girls who have had their futures stolen and sold into the eternal strife of gender struggle because they didn't work 'vigorously' enough to support Hillary Clinton.Are women the victims, or are they part of the problem?You wrote that you were 'shook to your core' because the public's reaction to Ms. Clinton was the result of a specific message that had been sent to, in particular, female viewers.Which was it? Were you shook by the message or the reaction? Or the fact that the women were not able to see through the marketing?We have written an answer to your call that 'She is out there somewhere'.- SexiLeaks
