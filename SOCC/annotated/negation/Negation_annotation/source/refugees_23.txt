Europe has done a HUGE amount to help refugees, taking in literally millions and spending billions on supporting them.Canada has helped for sure too, just not nearly to the same extent.But the problem is so huge, you cannot expect Western countries to fix this, without actually going in militarily and recolonizing the region. But that is not going to happen!
