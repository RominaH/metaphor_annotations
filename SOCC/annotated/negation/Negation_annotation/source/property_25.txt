Given that the majority of offshore buyers in metro Vancouver are from China, and given that capital gains exemptions do not apply to them on the sale of property, would this tax on real estate also equate to a 'head tax'?Given that principal residence tax exemptions do not apply to offshore owners who live in the houses they have purchased, and in which they can reside for half the year (which may be even longer than some snowbirds and frequent travellers), and again given that the majority of these part time residents are from China, is this also a 'head tax'?In our schools and universities (like UBC), the largest overseas student demographic by far comes from China. We charge substantially more for tuition for these students. Is charging an overseas buyer of education so much more, also a form of a 'head tax'?Sorry professor, but your grade is not very high on this opinion piece.
