My proposal for a fair system:1- buy back all existing licences at the current. Purchase cost about 4.5k, regardless of what their 'market value is'. 2- put in place a bi-yearly permit system for all drivers regardless of whether or not they are using uber or another taxi app. 3- every 6 months have a driver come in and pay for a permit for a particular car and him/herself (no middleman licence holders!). At the time of permitting a driver needs to show a safety inspection for the vehicle and sufficient insurance coverage paid foe the next 6months. ( the city could even provide an additional insurance plan for a cost!) 4- in addition a driver needs to show a clean driving record for the previous 6 months, no demerit points lost ; if not they get a warning and after two consecutive 6 month periods of warnings, they cannot buy a permit.5- the up to dat permit needs to be clearly visible at all times. 6- if they switch cars or buy a new one, the driver needs to get a new permit and safety inspection for that car,any outstanding days left on the old car should be prorated. This would go along way to open up the market while insuring minimum standards for vehicle and driver and get rid of the middlemen licence holders...
