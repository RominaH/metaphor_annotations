It is a valid question to ask, but Mr. Yu focuses more on the racist past than the very different present, and his comment that 'There had been no public outcry about wealthy British migrants or American actors buying vacation homes' is both disingenuous and wrong. Disingenuous because it's not nearly as anguishing or important to be denied the privilege of a vacation home due to frenzied demand/prices, as it is to be denied the possibility to buy a home to raise your growing family in the city where you work; and because U.S. and British buying was not nearly as prolific (not surprisingly, since their populations are much smaller). And his statement is wrong because in fact there HAD been a public outcry from the permanent residents of the Gulf Islands and elsewhere when U.S. and British buyers caused prices to spike, causing hardship for local workers and year-round residents who wished a home for themselves or their offspring. But perhaps Mr. Yu is being selective about whose outcry is important?
