So in other words (Gasp!) the Federal surplus is built on restraining money flowing to the provinces to cover such things as health care (for which Harper conveniently announced a fixed rate of increases in Federal transfers) and, in effect, said, 'Any increases above the rate of inflation for health care is your problem.'Funny how the Conservatives still castigate Paul Martin for 'balancing the books on the back of the provinces', isn't it?Pity we aren't having discussions about the points raised in this column, isn't it?
