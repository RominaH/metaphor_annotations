C'mom, Mr. Yu, you want to say it is the new head tax, just say so, why all those weasel words and fake question marks? Your logics is laughable and playing the race card is all too transparent. The tax is for all foreigners, just because most of the players in the current Vancouver market is Chinese doesn't make it racist. Will you have the same question of head tax if it is mostly the Russians who buys real estate in Vancouver and now face the 15% tax? I guess not!
