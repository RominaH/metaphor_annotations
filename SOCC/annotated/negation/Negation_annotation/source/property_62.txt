My partner is Chinese Canadian and i can tell you the 'old' Chinese community in Vancouver thinks this tax is long overdue and that the government (at all levels) has been completely taken in or are being paid off. There has been money laundering for years and people not paying taxes or claiming welfare while living in multi-million dollar homes. It's an open truth in the Asian community and has been for years. Are you going to call my Chinese mother in law a racist or a resentful immigrant who doesn't like it when new immigrants come? And CRA doesn't crack down on tax evasion for fear of being racist? This is completely ridiculous and leads to people like Trump!!!
