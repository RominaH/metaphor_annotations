No Harper bashing here - it's all been said - but we're left with a more important issue than his personal integrity - what to do about the provinces' finances.Many provinces have yet to make any hard choices, especially here in Ontario where union pay increases all violate the Premier's own line that there will be no more money unless there are commensurate cuts elsewhere. Yes, the provinces own health and education, which are full of highly paid professionals, but where are the changes we need to measure and improve outcomes and efficiency, at least in these two key ministries?Those will be the hard choices that will make provincial finances sustainable, but nothing has been done to make meaningful progress. Federal surpluses are good, but not sufficient. We're still going to have to pay more.
