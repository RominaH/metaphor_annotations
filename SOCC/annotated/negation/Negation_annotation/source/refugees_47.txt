Perhaps the author ought to spend a few weeks driving across this giant nation and visiting communities small and large to learn first hand why it may be so hard to find jobs, dentists or even housing that is suitable for incoming refugees.She would quickly learn jobs are very hard for established Canadians to find, dentists are very often too expensive for many of us and housing, well yes there are many houses available if the prospective tenants don't mind living in some godforsaken former Saskatchewan farm village a few concessions away from the Trans-Canada Highway.The author tosses about numbers as though the loss of $200 Billion to the Syrian economy matters to anyone but a bankster when the real loss is an estimated 250,000 Syrian lives.Sure, speak out and encourage Canada to do more, but just remember, 'til Oct 19, 2015 our government had plans to bring exactly 0 Syrian refugees to Canada.
