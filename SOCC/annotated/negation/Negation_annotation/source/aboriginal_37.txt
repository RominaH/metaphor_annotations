In my province of B.C., despite the fact that aboriginal children represent only about eight per cent of the child population, more than 50 per cent of the total children in care are aboriginal..........................................................................................................................In late 2012, it was reported that 8,000 of the 9,000 in care in Manitoba  were aboriginal.Many First Nations problems start on the reserves. An broad investigation of child care or violence against native women may well pose a much wider problem.
