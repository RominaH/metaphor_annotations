Either way, that's irrelevant. 

Does anyone expect to see the same cabbie day after day? Or even to see them ever again? 

Nope. 

The obnoxious colour they paint their cars is the only thing that bears any continuity for a paying customer. Beyond that, they get into a Camry one day, a Crown Vic another, one is maintained and clean, another is a falling apart jalopy. 

Their drivers come and go too.

That is just not a selling point.
