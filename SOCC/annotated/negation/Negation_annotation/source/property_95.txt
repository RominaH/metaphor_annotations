This is not a tax to come, live and work in Canada. It is a sales tax on a real estate transaction. It only applies to purchases within Greater Vancouver of residential properties by foreign nationals, corporations or trustees. If they want to purchase a property but avoid the tax, they can purchase outside the district.So the answer to 'is this a head tax' is unequivocally no.
