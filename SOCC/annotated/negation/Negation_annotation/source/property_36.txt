I hate to break bad news but most of the complainers about housing prices in Vancouver will not be able to afford a house even IF Foreign buyers were eliminated and prices dropped 30%. You'll still be outbid by some wealthy Easterner whose kids are grown up so they sell the house in TO and retire to BC, thus driving up prices. And you'll still notice a lot of Chinese Canadian homeowners who worked hard instead of complaining.Accept your lot in life and buy a crackhouse in the Downtown Eastside and gentrify it. That's how people have been making money in Real Estate since Cities had ghettos.
