Oh yes, it's so easy to balance the budget! So easy! How's Wynne doing in Ontario, I wonder. She gets billions more each year in transfers for health, infrastructure, education from the federal government. She gave cops (OPP) an extra about 10% two years ago, even the 10%-ers, the teachers, got a raise a few weeks ago (despite 'net-zero' promises). Surely, Ontario must have a large surplus! Or at least a negligible surplus or deficit.What?! She's running a $10 billion deficit on top of $10 billion off the books on 'infrastructure'? $20 billion more debt? Every year?! But... it's so easy to get surpluses! Simpson says so. Obama can't do it. Cameron can't do it. Hollande can't do it. Wynne certainly can't do it... strange, since it's so easy.
