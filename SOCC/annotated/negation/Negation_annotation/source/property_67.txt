One big difference not mentioned is that this tax applies to real estate, not to people. But that's a digression. Let's assume for a moment that the Vancouver real estate market is in balance and that only Canadians or permanent residents can buy. Now let's open the market up to anyone who wishes to buy, and in this case buyers outnumber sellers by a small amount...say 5%. What's going to happen to house prices? If left unchecked the market will eventually rebalance at some higher value that will likely be beyond the ability of most Canadians to afford. It seems to me that real estate should be affordable to at least the majority of Canadians before allowing foreign buyers to compete. After real estate, what next? Jobs?
