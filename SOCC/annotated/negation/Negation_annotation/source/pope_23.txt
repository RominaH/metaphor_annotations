Then there is also the pope’s meeting with Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue gay marriage licenses on religious grounds.  The pontiff likened her to a conscientious objector; a false analogy, since conscientious objectors didn’t join the army and then refuse to fight;  they refused to join the army in the first place.  If Kim Davis were truly comparable to a conscientious objector, she would have resigned from her job the minute she was asked to issue a gay marriage license, rather than continue and try to force her religious views on others in lieu of performing her professional duties.
