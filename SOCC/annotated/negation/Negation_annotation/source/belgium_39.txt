How do you know Canada will not end up fractured just like Belgium? 

We already have many factions in Canada just like Belgium which will only get more pronounced with a proportional system. These include Quebec (its own little world). English/French, Western Canada/Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, urban/rural, anti-gun/pro-gun, et.c, etc.

Are you ready to roll the dice with Canada's future? Please say no. Rather say, I won't gamble on something this important.
