I really think it ill-serves the body politic, to continue to make this election into a referendum on something it wasn't, namely the competence of women. As other posters have noted, there have been many many women leaders throughout history. This is not a new thing. Hillary Clinton was as hawkish as any man, when it came to Iraq, as pusillaminous as anyone else, when it came to standing up to Wall Street. She could not successfully divorce herself from her very tainted history to represent the change that the clearly disenfranchised, or at least self-perceived disenfranchised, so desperately wanted.
