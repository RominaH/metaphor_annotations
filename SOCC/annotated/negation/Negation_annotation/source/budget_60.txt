Mr. Flaherty remonstrated that he could easily show a balanced budget for 2014-15, even a surplus. No, instructed his boss, always thinking politically. It would be better to save the news - the surprise! - until the fall of 2015, that is during an election.Well, I knew it, half of Ottawa knew it, lets see if the Canadian voters know it.Harper and his motley crew of Reformers are once again caught in on of their numerous lies. After drastic cuts to Veterans Affairs, Immigration (350 million dollars), Aboriginal Affairs, healthcare, the CBC and many other government departments, the fact the budget was balanced in 2014/15 was an afterthought.Thus the question we'll be facing in October; do we want a government that will actually govern and make the hard decisions that are called for in these challenging times, or do we want a Harper government that spends 90% of its time campaigning instead of governing.I for one have seen enough off these far-right Harper Reformers. Lets hope the vast majority of Canadians agree with my 'sentiments'..
