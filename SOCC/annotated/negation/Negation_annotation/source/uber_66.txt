Not a chance. Uber drivers are rated - instantly, online - by their passengers. For really bad ratings, Uber contacts the passenger directly (via email). Any complaint of decrepit etc. cars gets the driver suspended.On the other hand, if a drunken passenger throws up in an Uber car, all the driver needs to do is email a picture to Uber and he gets fully reimbursed. Uber charges the amount to the drunken passenger's credit card.Try complaining about crappy taxi-cabs! Or, if you are a cabby, try getting reimbursed from your drunken passenger.
