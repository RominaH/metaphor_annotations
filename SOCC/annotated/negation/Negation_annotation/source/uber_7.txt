At $80 for a 20 min cab ride (just using the figures provided), that works out to $240/hr. Now, of course, there are legitimate and reasonable costs associated with purchasing, maintaining, and operating the vehicle which need to be accounted for, but that comes out to nowhere near $240/hr.

The problem with the current system is there are a small number of people earning a lot of money for doing little/no work for it. Cut out these middle men (who provide no actual value to the system) and fares can be lowered while drivers earn a reasonable wage.
