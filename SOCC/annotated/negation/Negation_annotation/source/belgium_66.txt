Nope, the immigrants have turned to organized crime. Think the Italian Mafia, Chinese Triads, Latino Cartels, etc. This happens because the immigrants have a hard time finding regular jobs due to discrimination.

As for terrorism, diasporas are often involved due to their inflated patriotism. In Canada we have seen Irish/Sikh/Tamil/Islamic terrorists living here. There have also been the FLQ, communists, and other ideological terrorists (who I don't know a lot about).
