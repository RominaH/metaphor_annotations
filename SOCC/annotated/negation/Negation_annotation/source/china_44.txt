Oh come on. The full arctic is not ALL Canadian. We have a certain aspect, Russia has a certain aspect. And if we want to get historical, Russia has been around far longer than Canada has, hence they have a legitimate historical claim to the whole arctic. Other than that, If you folks looked into your history books that go past the 17th century all the way to the 6th, you will see that China has a historical claim to the South China Sea. Hence the name, South CHINA Sea. If it was not historically China's then perhaps the west should have renamed the area South Asian Sea. or South East Pacific Sea. But come on folks. The USA is a dying empire. It has not even won a legitimate war against a major world power in 3 quarters of a century. The USA is in deep debt and no way to dig its self out. Russia and China see the fall coming. Perhaps it is time we in Canada started to cozy up to them and not our southern racist neighbors. Perhaps with 2 countries that really could care less about their over all profit margins and more about the well fare of their own people. And no Clinton will not change crap. It will just be the same old same old with her. Except Russia and China will steam roll over her and let her walk into a global conflict.
