A great plan, but let's not forget that if the NDP had not joined the Conservatives in such a hurry to bring down the Liberal government in 2006 which had just established a national child care program (not promised, or planne4d, but established), Canada would have already had a national day care plan for EIGHT long years.  They know full well that bringing down the Paul Martin would result in that move if the Conservatives took office.
