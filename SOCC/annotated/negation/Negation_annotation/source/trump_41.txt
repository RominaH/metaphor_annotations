Here's why I think the remainers got wrong against the BREXIT supporters.    A lot of the debate were not about addressing the real issues.  It was about elites trying to make themselves feel good by explaining how stupid and backwards people who wanted to leave are.  In the case of Trump, Michael Moore warned everyone by painting Trump as dangerous, and his fear was most vocalized when he warned his fellow progressives not to attack his followers but to show why Trump is just conning them.   Moore sees Trump's supporters as decent people who have legitimate problems that are not being addressed, and attacking them as backwards deplorable irredeemable was the worse strategy possible.But what did the progressives do?  They said only stupid racist hateful people support Trump.   It was almost like Trump successfully pulled off an Alinsky tactic by baiting the establishment progressives into overreacting and making his supporters even more convinced that he was going to blow the whole place up.I think Moore's plan was difficult to pull off because neither Hillary nor Moore or just about anyone else had the ability to connect to the rust belt and hurting 'deplorables' the same way Trump could --- it's all about people skills.Besides, there was no way Clinton could say that if Ford wanted to move their factory to mexico, she would slap a 35% tarriff when they ship the cars back to the US --- no way Wall Street could tolerate that.   But this was EXACTLY what Moore wished she could say.
