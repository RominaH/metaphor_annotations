The media must accept a certain amount of blame via their simple minded coverage and their pursuit of a free press (media) for all the wrong reasons (mostly salacious gossip and less important stories) instead of the right reasons (what of real importance is going on in government that the people need to know about to make informed decisions.) Of course much of this behaviour is a natural consequence of the pursuit of capitalism and profit and human nature, but the problem is the pretence that this is an honourable profession with high minded principles. The men (and they were almost all men) of that belief are either long gone or toiling elsewhere because the big profit machines won't tolerate the expense of their pursuits.And yes the leaders , excluding Harper who is just purely a bad egg, lack the courage to take the risk to put a campaign of real issues on the table. (Though I think Trudeau comes closest with his more honest moments dubbed 'flubs' and bozo eruptions or and indication be is not ready or too inexperienced i.e. not yet learned the lesson that and election is not th time to discuss serious new policy on issues).As to campaigns, nothing truer was ever said in a Canadian political campaign (I was too naive and idealistic to understand it at the time) than Kim Campbell 'The election is not a time to discuss serious issues'.
