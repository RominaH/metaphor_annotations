The first world relates to per capita income, and now how that income was achieved. Take away the loot the the UK, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, etc stole from Asia, Africa and Latin America, and they would all be third world countries too. Don't believe me? Look up the kohinoor diamond - where it was, and where it is today.
