Nobody really cares if a woman or man holds the highest office, is a BOD or the CEO of a fortune 500 company.People just don't care, most of us have far more important things in life to worry about.Hillary is not a woman running for office, she was a person competing for a job and the people decided she didn't fit the bill.Get over it!
