exactly what I was going for. If equally sketchy, both countries (and others who do the same) should be equally chastised. China shouldn't be singled out simply because it has the ability to do more of it.... But other countries should be included in the same discussion, especially if they are the ones providing the harshest criticism on China (while they are doing the same exact thing)
