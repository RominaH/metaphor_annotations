I had a health scare last year, and ended up being admitted to Royal Inland Hospital in Kamloops for a few days (all ended up being well, but it was a bit scary at first). As I lay in Emergency the night I was admitted, I had my iPod Classic (160 gb) with me, and was listening to it. An orderly came by to check on me, and when he saw it he said 'That's really old school' (it's about 8 years old). And I - who remember when a Walkman was a marvel - thought how odd it was that something so relatively new and amazing was, just a few years later, almost obsolete.How obsolete? Well, Apple has stopped making them. Think about it: they made something that did just one thing and did it brilliantly, allowing users to store an incredible amount of music in a small portable device, but now that's gone, as they try to sell us on other gadgets that yes, will store music, but only a fraction of what the Classic could hold. Like Elizabeth Renzetti, I get by just fine with a Blackberry (for basic communication). I also wear a wristwatch (a Citizen Eco-Drive; never needs batteries), and for entertainment use my iPod Classic. When the Classic packs in I'll only be able to replace it with something that either a) holds a fraction of what the Classic can and/or b) does a whole lot of other things I don't want or need. Which I guess is good for Apple's bottom line, but isn't what I consider progress.
