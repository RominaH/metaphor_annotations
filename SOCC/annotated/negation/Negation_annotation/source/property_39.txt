I love the way all sorts of businesses have their market protected in Canada (think dairy, airlines, cable, wireless, etc. etc. etc.) because they can't compete with global competitors but the 'free market' folks are quick to suggest Canada should provide open and completely unfettered access to our housing market, one of the most basic necessities of life. Obvious who has lobbyists and who doesn't. Compete with global incomes you dumb Canadians, it's making everyone connected to real estate rich!
