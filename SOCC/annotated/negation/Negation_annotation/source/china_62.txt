This column is alarmist in the extreme and also, unfortunately, surprisingly blind to Western excesses. Has anything that China has done in the recent past even come anywhere close to the illegality, instability-causing, and sheer assault on international institutions of the US invasion of Iraq? Of course not. So, when the Chinese claim that the West is applying 'double-standards' they are, unquestionably, correct. That does not excuse what China is doing in the South China Sea. Mr. Burton is correct to say that, legally, China has no case and its aggressive response is unproductive. But, again, China is simply following in the footsteps of Westerners. It is treating the surrounding region as the US has treated Latin America and the Middle East. China is actually a far better follower of international law than the US. Mr. Burton should simply know better than to stir up this kind of jingoistic nonsense.
