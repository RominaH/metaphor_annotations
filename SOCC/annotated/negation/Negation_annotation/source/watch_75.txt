Thanks for your reply. Perhaps 'line in the sand' was the wrong simile (or expression). I'm just pointing out that everyone gets to a point at which they're comfortable with the way they do things. There's no reason to embrace new technology if what you have and are used to does what you want it to. But there's also nothing wrong with wanting to do things 'the new way' because we all did things in new ways at some point in our lives.I'm not much younger than you I suspect since my eldest is only a few years younger than yours but I think I might still be more open to 'the latest thing'.
