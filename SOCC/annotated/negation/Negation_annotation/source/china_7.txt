'The proposal has strong resonance in China domestically, as it would show Beijing fulfilling Mao's mandate. 'It also resonates strongly with overseas Chinese, no matter how long have they lived in the Western liberal society.

But when it comes to the old motherland, hot blood boil immediately, there is no discussion especially when it comes to South China Sea and Japan.

If we think otherwise, we are gullible.
