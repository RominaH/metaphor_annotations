Seniors vote. Hence the promises and the continued greatest injustice where seniors with income up to $70k per year ( over $100k with dual earners) receive Old Age Security. Thus with average family incomes in the $45k range, families with mortgages and education costs are subsidizing seniors who make more money than them. The right thing to do would be to lower the threshold to average income and top up those seniors struggling on lower incomes. No party has the nerve to do the right thing.
