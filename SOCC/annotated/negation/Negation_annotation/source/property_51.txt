It's absolutely not racist, I've lived in Vancouver since I was born and it's gotten to the point where there's a mass exodus of locals (of any race) to find somewhere where they can live in a reasonable way. Vancouver is becoming (if it hasn't already) a city with 2 classes the rich, or the just trying to scrape by. And I major part of that is due to exploitative foreign investment. I think people wouldn't be so upset if it weren't for the fact that many of these buyers either leave the purchased property empty as an investment, or have no interest in becoming part of the community at large viewing BC not as a new home but something to be taken advantage of. There are clubs, businesses, even entire suburbs where you are not welcome as an outsider or will struggle to get fair service. I have no problem with Chinese people or Koreans in fact I lived in Japan and Korea for 3 years and loved the places and it's peoples. or issues with anyone else, I'm French Canadian and first Nations. If masses of French citizens were doing the same thing I'd have just as much of a problem.I think if anything this article shows how much of an issue Chinese exploitative investment is, when BC passes a tax on 'foreign' buyers and there's instantly a backlash of people claiming it's racism against the Chinese just shows how disproportionately large of a stake China has compared to anyone else.
