Certainly. The 15% tax on 'non-residents' is the most blatant and offensive racist attack I have witnessed in recent memory. I am shocked that so few Canadians see it as such. What will it take to wake people up to the xenophobic nature of this tax? We should be welcoming wealthy immigrants to our country for many reasons, not the least of which is their potential to contribute to legitimate economic growth.
