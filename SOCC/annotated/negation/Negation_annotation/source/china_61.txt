There are some errors in this column. The Permanent Court of Arbitration is a private organization and has nothing to do with the UN. The UN has no position on the Philippines vs China case.There is no international consensus on the South China Sea ruling. So far only the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Philippines, and Vietnam has said the case was binding. All other countries have released statements exhorting the importance of UNCLOS and the need for a peaceful settlement.If it comes to military force, then China will crush the Philippines navy in a couple of days. The Philippines navy is the weakest in Asia with obsolete boats and little fuel and ammunition.China has continuously called for peaceful negotiation with the Philippines and other countries. The new Philippines President, Rodrigo Duterte, seems to want negotiation with China as he wants Chinese investment in infrastructure.
