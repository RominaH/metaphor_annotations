The left-wing city council will always vote to protect the entrenched cartel system. They are generally against the Conservative ideas of free market/technology etc which is what Uber is basically doing....I'm sure at the turn of the 20th century some of these left-wing city councilors would demand the car be outlawed if they thought it would protect the horse and buggie industry.
