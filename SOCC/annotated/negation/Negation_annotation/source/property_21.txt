Foreign speculators and money launderers have made Vancouver unaffordable for Canadians. If most of them are Chinese, and I don't know that they are, tough.The law should have gone further to address what is, in reality, a crisis. A moratorium on housing purchases by foreigners should have been passed to force a correction.All the tax did was kick the can a few feet down the road. Just the cost of doing business to the speculators and the crooks.Canada needs to protect the well-being of Canadians first, not as a feeble afterthought.
