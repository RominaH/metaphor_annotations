Small surplus, small deficit; irrelevant to me (I also didn't blame them for the deficits that occurred during the 2008 recession). Especially when you see how they have manipulated it. I think the departmental spending aspect is underestimated; the PS is very dysfunctional now, and many of the managerial level can't be trusted when bonuses revolve around returning unspent funds, or the funds are included in budgets but never make it to the departments at all. Anyway, we all now that a balance sheet can be manipulated if you want to, and the Cons want.Being good fiscal stewards is a lot more than booking a deficit/surplus. It includes sensible tax policy, infrastructure planning over multiple years, social program spending..... many, many different areas. In sum, at any one moment, the economy is doing well, or it isn't. Canadians are doing well, or they aren't. Most of us make our decision based on our take on the big picture. For me, although we aren't the worst basket case in the neighborhood, yet, it is clear the paint is starting to peel, and this government has done a poor job of managing finances overall. I do not trust the integrity or the competence of the Con front bench to make good decisions, so voting for them is beyond question. Not going to happen. A tiny surplus does nothing to change that.
