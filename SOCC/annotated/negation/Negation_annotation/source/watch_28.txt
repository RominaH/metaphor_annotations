@Rich Mole.....I am pretty sure you can still buy a cassette deck although you have to buy it from India or China. I haven't searched lately but a year ago I got one for a buddy by doing a google search and got it out of India so at that time they were available. The one I got had some weird name but it worked perfectly and still does.
