I don't understand why this was supposed to be such a historic moment.  Females have been elected Prime Ministers in Great Britain and Chancellors in Germany - and many other countries as well i'm sure.  To be honest, it makes you look even weak to make such a big deal of this.  I never thought that gender was an issue in politics until this election.  Race with Obama definitely but gender I didn't think was a big deal.
