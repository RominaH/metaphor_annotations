Canadians want it both ways.  They want good and decent wages but want to pay low prices.  It doesn't work that way.  You can push out the drivers of taxi business and make it all Uber drivers.  There are insurance, safety, inspection, first aid, legal and so on issues.  While such risk is small it exist.  It does go against the sense of fair play when a company can show up, not pay wages to employees, call them contractors, operate a company outside of all the regulations and have none of the cost.Why doesn't Uber just follow the rules and get a license like everyone else who wants to pickup people for hire in the city?
