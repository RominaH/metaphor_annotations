Another misguided soul.Hillary isn't Mother Teresa and neither was Trump Moses.And neither have the qualifications or the personal character to aspire to the Presidency.Whatever Trump's misdeeds, Hillary and Bill outdid him in spades.Would you want a President who denigrated a 12-year old girl who was repeatedly beaten and raped to get a client off?Would you want a President who said she would do anything and say anything to achieve her personal goals?Oh, and by the way who said publicly that she had two persona - a public one and a private one.Would you want President who deliberately ignored repeated requests from her diplomats in Benghazi for more protection? She left her people hung out to dry there.Would you want a President who sanctioned the downfall of two Middle East countries who were no threat to the U.S.A.?Theses countries are now threats to the U.S.A. as Libya is under the influence of ISIS and Egypt has moved into Russia's sphere of influence.Hillary wasn't doing this for women she was doing this for herself and no one else.So stop with the pedestal - she has feet of clay.
