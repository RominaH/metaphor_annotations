A shake-up of the entrenched, calcified, corrupt system was in order. A more thoughtful and constructive approach couldn't survive the political/media process. So, we got the loose-cannon Trump. Will he make changes in the interest of ordinary Americans? Or, will he revert to type as a member of the economic elite, maintaining the advantages of his class? The best hope for real change may well come from people mobilizing in the wake of the chaos that Trump will bring. If that happens, the Trump presidency will not have been such a bad thing.
