Last week it was the call for a national pharma care program to pay for drugs. Now it is day care. I guess we no longer want responsibility for ourselves but expect government to look after everything for us. We cannot properly fund health care as it is and people think we should institute another expensive universal government program. As usual, it boils down to who pays and I suspect many think that someone else other than himself or herself will be paying. You know, like corporations, banks and the rich. We are overtaxed in this country as it is. Let's focus on funding healthcare and re-listing services de-listed by governments. As well, let's think about debt re-payment so that we do not leave a mountain of bills for the next generation.
