We just have to look at Quebec taxes - which are highest in North America - and so called day care program which is impossible to get into - and their tax gestapo.This type of government is like insurance. You're buying daycare 'insurance' and then you pay for it all life long whether you want it or need it or not.The other issue is that it is a proven fact - programs runs by the government cost about 150% more than private sector and create huge bureaucracy. So the insurance is also likely to be disproportionately more costly.
