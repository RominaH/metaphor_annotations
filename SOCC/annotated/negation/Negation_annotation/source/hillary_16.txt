But there have been many female leaders all around the world. I can't believe Americans rejected Hillary because she was a woman.The American author, philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris explains in one of his podcasts why he thinks Trump won the election. He blames the result to a large extent on American voters' reaction to, and their repudiation of, the left's analysis of the following issues: black/brown identity politics, concepts such as safe spaces and trigger warnings, new gender pronouns, a political correctness that makes, for example, a furor over 'racist' Halloween costumes, out-of-control immigration, and the left's seeming inability to seriously address the issues of Islamism and Islamist terrorism.Harris's explanation for why Americans turned away from Hillary Clinton makes more sense to me than Ms Henein's does.
