I share Margaret Wente's confusion over the adulation we see everywhere for Pope Francis.  When it comes to core Catholic beliefs, he is very conservative. After all, he was elected by a very conservative group of cardinals that has been stocked by the recent popes, all of whom where conservative too. So it was very unlikely they would choose anyone who would rock the boat. I think people are confusing his sincere personal preferences for humiity and a low key lifestyle  and a warm personality for openess and liberality. Pope Francis may deal with opposition through persuasion, example and kindness rather than force and pressure, but his goal is to lead back to the conservative fold, not a more open liberal place.
