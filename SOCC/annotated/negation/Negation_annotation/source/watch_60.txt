Innovation is the critical component to improving our lives, whether for basic information technology or health and well being. Canada is almost trailing the industrial world in the use of electronic health records and our joy of waging war on drug companies keeps us in the last quartile of pharmaceutical innovation because we can't afford the cost of risk, research and development.  It appears we enjoy adopting some technology at a fast pace but we assume the barrier to other technologies, primarily controlled by government, are not as important.
