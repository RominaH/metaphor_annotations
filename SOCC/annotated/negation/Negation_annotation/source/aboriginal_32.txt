I'm sure there are strong women in each of the reserves.  I think it's time the women who live on-reserve form their own support groups to help each other with a multitude of different aspects of raising children.  After all, as mentioned on this forum, it is the grandmothers and great aunts who are raising the children - and these women would have gone through the residential school system themselves.  Not all residential school experiences were bad, some were thankful to be away from their disfunctional families.Most of the reserves have a medical nurse - are they totally overwhelmed or could they be a resource before the fact rather than after the fact for what takes place on the reserve.The women who live off-reserve have more resources and non-profit groups to turn to for support and help.   Those on reserve probably do not.However, it would seem that help is really not wanted from non-native people, but we gget blamed for all the problems.Women - stand up for your children - male or female!!
