I am left t wonder is the G &M really that ignorant of the true facts or simply afraid to expose Uber for what they are.  Currently Uber drivers are operating with no insurance. The moment you agree to hold your car out for hire, you have breached your insurance contract and have immediately voided it, $50,000.00 fine for driving without valid insurance and $250,000.00 fine if you put a claim through after you have signed on with Uber for fraud. I'm sad at only one thing in my field as I practice law,I'm near retiring and such obvious and hectic lawsuits are on the way. Do Torontonians really hate their taxi industries that much that they will destroy the insurance industries to rid themselves of it. Get your heads out of the sand,,, Wake up Toronto, There is no Cartel, stop believing that a Taxi License issued by the City is a problem, its diverting your attention from the real fact that Uber is hijacking the transportation industry. Actually never mind,,, bring in your money,, legal actions on the way LoL
