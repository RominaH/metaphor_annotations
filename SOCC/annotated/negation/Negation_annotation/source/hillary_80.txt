Please stop whining.  Trump is a misogynist, racist buffoon and perhaps worse.  Clinton is, to put it in the most polite terms possible, ethically challenged and craven in what she will tolerate in her lust for power.  Neither of them is a stellar representative of their gender.Next time, put up a female candidate who outshines the male, not one who has sunk to his same level.  Simple.
