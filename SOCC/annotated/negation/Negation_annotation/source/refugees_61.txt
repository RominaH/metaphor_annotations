There is a difference between Europe's and Canada's position re Syrian refugees.Europe is easy to get to and millions have arrived in Europe with next to zero screening or vetting. Europe has adopted a humanitarian response born out of necessity.Canada, on the other hand, selects refugees, after weeks of interviews and examinations, based on whether or not they can be an economic asset to Canada.There is not much humanitarian about Canada's policy re Syria refugees, which is basically an extension of its immigration policy, as far as I can tell.Canada is picking the 'good' ones and leaving the 'bad' ones for Europe.And Canada is simply not taking it's fair share. Germany took 40 times more refugees than Canada last year. All the rich European countries have taken more than Canada.How many refugees is USA taking? Considering USA is largely to blame for the Syrian disaster, I think USA should take at least 3 million refugees.
