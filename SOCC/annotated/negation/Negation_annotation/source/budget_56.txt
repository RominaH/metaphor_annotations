Jeffrey.I agree that the surplus was planned and expected as part of the Cons re-election campaign. I disagree with the proposition that a small surplus is irrelevant compared with the Canadian economy or the Federal Government's budget. Balancing the books matters hugely in the private sector, it is an indicator that an organization is well managed. Further a surplus of .67% vs a small deficit, compounded over many years does have an impact.I'm inclined to give credit where it is due. The Cons have balanced the budget, which is nice. That said, there is a very, very long list of reasons beyond the budget why I won't vote for the Conservatives this election.
