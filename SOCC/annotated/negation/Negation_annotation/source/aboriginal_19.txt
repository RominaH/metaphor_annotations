First of all the FN popuation has nothing to do with India so I would switch up the vocab. The only place they are called Indian is in legislation which is grossly outdated. Secondly since the last residential school closed in 1996 there are a lot of current parents who were impacted either directly or indirectly by the system.  Would you say the slavery exceuse is running thin?  Because it shows a lack of awareness of the impact of intergenerational trauma and the challenges it causes on the community.
