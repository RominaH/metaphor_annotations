You mean Little Italy, Portugal, Kensington Market. The Irish Ghetto of Cabbagetown. Finnish in Thunder Bay. The Finnish even have a city named after themselves New Finland, SK or Uusi Suomi, SK. Ukrainians in parts of AB and SK. The English are in West Island Montreal. How dare they indeed.Maybe it is more complicated. Is Markham Chinese, yes, but I also see lots of South Asians, Filipinos, etc also. Looks like a richer version of Scarborough. Brampton, lots of South Asians but lots of Blacks and others also . We bring in mostly non-white immigrants. Wherever we build houses and condos, there will be more of them there. White people in the Beaches are not exactly moving out with immigrants replacing them. The diversity is fairly well spread out and mixed, in Brussels, it's different. I was there in 2014. The quality of immigrants is also different.U of T, Waterloo, York, Ryerson, etc looks a lot more diverse than Toronto. Universite de Bruxelle does not look like Brussels. Big difference.
