There's an approach that gets too little publicity. The Cons pass a budget. But much of that consists of individual projects that need Ministerial approval. So the Minister stalls and by year-end lots of funds are unspent. Hence the underfunding in Vet Affairs, refugee processing, foreign aid projects and the like.They try to pass this off as sound financial management but they're being devious. had they announced 10-15% cuts in various programs up front, there's be plenty of debate and controversy. Instead they announce no cuts but deliver them anyway and no one knows until 6 months after the books have closed. It's quite deliberate.
