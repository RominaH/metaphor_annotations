The Globe must be absolutely delighted with Trump's victory.  Now you have your Rob Ford on Steroids.  Nothing a paper like this enjoys more than having their favored candidate lose and conversely despise the winner; you've got so many things to look forward to in the next four years.  Only the jig is up.  With a Trump victory its proof the media is out of touch and the people can come up with their own thoughts and opinions.  You tried with Ignatieff way back and its well known he was a creation of the Globe backroom.  Keep it up.  Gives us peons something to talk about too.
