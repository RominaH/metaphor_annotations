A few of the comments point to the callousness of the Gulf states, including SA, for not taking in refugees. Very true. Also true is that the Gulf states, with Saudi Arabia in the lead, are responsible for much of the Syrian crises. The same Saudi Arabia that we sell weapons for use in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.One can sympathize with the perspective of fellow Canadians who question why we should be responsible for these, or any, refugees. That we have our own problems, including poverty. Such a perspective would be valid if Canada, and its western allies, were not meddling in the Middle East. Frequently, that involvement has not been helpful to say the least. We have directly and indirectly caused or stoked conflicts that created the refugee exodus.
