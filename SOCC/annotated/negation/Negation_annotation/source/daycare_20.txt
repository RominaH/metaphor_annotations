While I support the notion of subsidized daycare, a national daycare program is an expensive boondoggle waiting to happen.A means tested subsidy paid directly to parents who use qualified facilities would create opportunities to increase available spaces. I would support a subsidy using the following guidelines:First, no family with income over $100,000 per year should require a subsidy. Subsidies could be scaled according to income levels from 25% to 75%Second, people should expect to pay at least $10/day ($200/month) at any income level.Third, facilities that qualify for subsidies should be required to offer a minimum standard of service.
