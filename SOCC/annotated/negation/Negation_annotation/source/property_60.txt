Mr Yu, I am curious of your true motive of this article since the tax is explicitly applies to all buyers who are not Canadian. There are loopholes in the current market, and the government has a duty to address them. If it is true that foreign buyers is only a small percentage of the property sales, then the sales should have stayed the same after the tax is applied. You can argued that is only correlation, and only time can tell, but the fact is that sales have decreased. Also I am not sure if you know that even Hong Kong government imposed a similar tax. You so far has not provided evident which indicated this tax is applied to Chinese only?
