I feel about the same way you feel about your 'obsolete' ipod, Nebuly:  when we bought a new car a few years ago, I realized almost immediately that (gasp!) it didn't have an audio cassette machine!  This, after years of re-recording and collecting music on cassette tape--what to do?  Answer: remember the good times.  I do have a compact shelf-model CD/radio/cassette unit (TWIN cassette players, I might add) with small detachable speakers sitting in my home office. It is the only place I can play those cassettes, now. When that goes...well, maybe my hearing will have deteriorated to the point where it won't matter anymore...
