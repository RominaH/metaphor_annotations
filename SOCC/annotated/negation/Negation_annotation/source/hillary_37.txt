Huh? I am a woman who voted for Trump. Mrs. Clinton (even the New York Times reported on this in October) orchestrated attacks on the women who came forward to say Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted them. She hired DC private investigator Terry Lenzner to go after them. Mrs. Clinton was no friend to women if she considered them roadblocks on her desired path to power. Additionally, Donald Trump hired Kellyanne Conway the first female campaign manager in a Presidential campaign. She is being credited for steering Trump to victory. He also had Hope Hicks as his spokesperson. Trump is not afraid to hire strong and powerful and outspoken women
