It should be clear to everybody that the current relationship between main stream society and the First Nations is irreparably broken and dysfunctional.  Continuing to live in the past and rightly criticize past treatment by the white man may feel good but is done at great cost to the First Nations people.FN need to look to the future, not the past.  They need to join with the rest of Canadians in building a strong Canada.  To give up special status and living on reserves with outdated systems of governance.They always demand self government but when problems arise it is never their fault.  Come join in with the rest of us instead of your self imposed apartheid (a policy or system of segregation or discrimination on grounds of race).
