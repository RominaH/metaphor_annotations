Marie, I'm sorry but this is just a load of tripe and way beneath your standards. I'm disappointed but perhaps you are nothing more than an ultra feminist and can't see the forest for the trees. Hillary was deserted by her own party and they didn't turn out to vote. Why? Because her career as a politician is spotty at best (you never heard anything during the campaign about her past achievements other than she held the office) so she could not run on that; her husband is a philanderer and she should have left him in the dust as soon as the Lewinsky affair broke (instead she stayed with the corrupt Bill to continue to forge the power plays that so illuminate their lives); and she was selected by a party which knee capped Bernie Sanders who would have been a far more worthy candidate. Neither my wife or daughter look to Hillary at all for any kind of guidance, leadership etc. or to see what a woman can achieve. I'm simply at a loss to understand how a woman of your achievement would think there is some injustice in the world post election. Hillary received exactly what she deserved.
