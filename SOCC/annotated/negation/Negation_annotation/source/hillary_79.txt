Perhaps I can impart some advice to the young ladies who stayed up expecting to see a female President.  Your parents misled you.  Democracy can deliver results not anticipated.  There is no certain outcome. This is the strength of democracy reiterating the importance of the difference of opinion. You have been delivered an early lesson in life that your parents are not perfect.  The more important messages, lost on your parents, comes from baseball, and a certainty of life.  'It ain't over 'til it's over.'  And from a band,  'You can't always get what you want'.
