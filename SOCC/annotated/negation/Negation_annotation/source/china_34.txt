I read this article over again and it's still not clear what the 'driving force' is behind 'Beijing's moves in the South China Sea'.  Would the Chinese still be doing the same thing if they actually trusted the U.S.?  Or are they motivated by seeing what the U.S. has done in the Middle East (and elsewhere) ?
