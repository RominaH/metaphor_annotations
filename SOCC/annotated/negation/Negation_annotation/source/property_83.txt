The author is off base and his article is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.This tax is nothing like the head tax. First, it is not Canada wide as was the case with the head tax. Second, all foreigners, including Chinese, are able to enter this country and live here without paying this tax by renting a property. Third, the tax is not exclusive to Chinese as the head tax was. Although Chinese are most affected by the tax, there are plenty of American film and software workers moving here who are also affected. Last year was a record year for film and TV. Microsoft, EA Sports, Dreamworks and many others are big employers in Vancouver, and many are expanding.Finally, many other countries have similar restrictions or taxes - Switzerland and Thailand are two that come to mind. If the author thinks that this is racist, he should be calling out China. It has had nationwide restrictions since 2006, where foreigners can only own one property for personal use, and then only after living in the country for a year. There are also legislated restrictions on the ability of foreigners to get a mortgage. Contrast this with the ability of Chinese who are non resident in Canada, who are able to theoretically buy hundreds of houses, with no restrictions on a bank lending them money - if they pay the tax.
