Simpson is right: it's a political winner and a policy dud - just political smoke and mirrors. Mulcair wants Canada to adopt a national childcare model so he can hang on to seats in Quebec, that's all. Years ago I worked with a political strategist working to get a Liberal candidate elected in Conservative Calgary. He actually told his client to talk about national daycare - this was in the early 90's. The Liberal candidate said, 'Canada can't afford that!' to which the strategist responded 'Just say the words, you don't have to actually do it. It'll be good for votes.' I could barely believe the cynicism, but over the years I've come to realize that's what it is: vote getting and power politics. Same thing here.
