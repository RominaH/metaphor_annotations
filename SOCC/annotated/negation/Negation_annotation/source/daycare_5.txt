Harper promised 15% discount of 1000 dollars spent on children's sports activities. Mulcair promises 15 dollar a day child care. I will go with Mulcair. Harper helps rich parents who can afford 1000 dollars sports activities per child. Mulcair cares for the middle and poor class. Lot of parents could not afford second child because of huge child care expenses. We should not entirely depend on the immigration population. We need more canadian born people. If there will be any economic armagaddon like greece, all the immigrants will disappear and make the situation worse, but canadian born people will never leave this beautiful country. Thomas, Bring it on. You are the next prime minister.
