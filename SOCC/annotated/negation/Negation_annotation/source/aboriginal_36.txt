In all the years that indian residential schools operated, from the first ones in the late 1600s to the last ones kept open into the 1990s at the request of the reserves they served, only about 150,000 students ever attended. The current indian population in Canada is around one million.Given that the students from the 1600s well into the 1900s are mostly dead of old age, that leaves at most 10%, and probably less, of the indian population ever saw the inside of one of these schools.The excuse is running thin.
