I agree with the need to end the cartel, the artificial rationing of taxi licenses and the re-sale of existing licenses. And I don't care what brings the car to me . . . a fancy phone app, a phone call or smoke signals. But when that car arrives, I have a right to know that the driver is adequately licensed to transport passengers for hire, that the car has passed a commercial safety inspection, that the car and driver carry adequate commercial insurance and that the driver has been screened and is not a known sex offender, drug user or dangerous criminal.
