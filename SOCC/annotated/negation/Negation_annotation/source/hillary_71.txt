Ms. Henein:    I'm a feminist too.  And guess what?  I fully get that when you defended Ghomeshi at his trial, you were merely doing your job.  I never held it against you.  There are many other sensible feminists besides me (both male and female) who also see it that way.But I can't help but feel like this article is simply about you trying to redeem yourself in the eyes of those who accused you of betraying the feminist cause. I respect you as the top notch lawyer that you are, but this column is very unbecoming.
