I completely agree with Henein when she writes, “The problem is bigger than Mr. Trump”. While I find Trump to be completely abhorrent, in essence, he has only served to reflect a society that is deeply divided and very frustrated. He has served to illuminate and give a platform to misogynistic, racist & isolationist/nationalist idealism. It is a frightening state of affairs here in America. That said, Hillary Clinton DID win the popular vote. One of the biggest problems in America is the electoral college. Now, twice in recent history, two extremely qualified candidates have lost the election b/c of the electoral college: Hillary Clinton & Al Gore. We need to let the people’s true voices be heard. We need to amend the constitution and abolish the electoral college. It was established by the founding fathers of America to ensure equal representation for each state, but it is now completely antiquated and detrimental to America. In fact, I can think of a few constitutional amendments that need to be abolished …starting with the 2nd amendment!!! (But, I digress)2) I somewhat agree with Henein when she writes, “She lost because she was a woman”. While I agree that it was one of the factors, I certainly did not vote for Hillary b/c she was a woman and I hope no one else did either! I voted for Hillary b/c I have the utmost respect for her 30 years of public service, her balanced thoughtful approach to making decisions and b/c she is the most qualified candidate to have EVER run for the highest office in America! In fact, it frustrated me when Hillary kept referring to “the glass ceiling”. While I understand that it is not the case right now, every women should be judged on her merit alone….not the color of her pantsuit.I am confident that within our lifetime we will be addressing a “Madam President”. Why?  ...Because we are raising woman that BELIEVE they CAN be president. For that, (among so many other reasons), I am thankful to women like Hillary Clinton.
