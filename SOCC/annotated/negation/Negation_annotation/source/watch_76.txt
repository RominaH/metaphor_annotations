That's actually a really good point! When people spend north of $10K on a watch, they expect it to last the rest of their lives or at least a good long time. Apple is going to have to ensure the Watch is compatible with future iPhones too. If they end up obsolescing the $13K watch in two years they will generate quite the backlash.
