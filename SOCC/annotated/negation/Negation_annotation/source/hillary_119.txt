You know, Maggie Thatcher broke that glass ceiling.She destroyed the North of England, as Minister of Education took my milk away when I was in school, got re-elected by going to war over a sheep infested island that really belongs to another country. This isn't about women...they can be just as corrupt and evil as men in politcs. Look at Wynne. I don't recall gnashing and whaling when Campbell was obliterated by Chretien. And look how that turned out with the Sponsorship Scandal.Clinton lost because Trump knew he had to carry a few mid-western states and Florida, Pennsylvania and there were alot of pissed off people there not buying the establishment and elitism that was the Clinton brand. He tapped into the I will give you a voice because all those in these states are hearing  is white privilege but they see nothing but jobs lost and rusting factories. Will everyone be happy of Marine LePen gets elected? Or if Kellie Leitch wins the Conservative ballot? Would you be happy with a far right wing women in power? Sarah Palin was on a Presidential ticket and I don't recall any wailing when she and McCain were defeated. The over the top reactions, the oh my God what do I tell my children, I don't feel safe now, we're doomed, doomed I tell you.... get a grip of yourselves, choose wisely next election, get involved in mid-terms and choose to back the best candidate regrdless of ethnic origin or what reproductive equipment they have.
