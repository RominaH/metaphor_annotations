I'm not upset at all; I have my 160gb Classic and love it, and am really glad Apple made it. I'm just sorry that there's now nothing on the market that can touch it for storage/capacity. As I said: the Classic did one thing and did it brilliantly, and now the only replacement is something with a fraction of the storage space. So, yeah, progress, I suppose.
