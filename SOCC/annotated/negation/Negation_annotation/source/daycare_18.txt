This whole concept of 'national daycare' sounds far too idealistic. The he## is in the details as they say. Those on lower incomes who struggle to pay there rent and pay basic bills need help. In those cases, subsidised daycare could help both spouses to work outside the house without daycare draining all their efforts. But what about the majority of income earners. Do they really need government assistance? Many comfortably off people will shift their discretionary income (from saved daycare costs) to buy a larger house or more expensive doodads. That is hardly helping families truly in need.We need more targeted programs to help those with low incomes. Not a limousine style daycare system.I self define as liberal, but a very fiscally tight one.
