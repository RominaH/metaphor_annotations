Why did Europe close the borders? A shortage of doctors, dentists, day cares? Do they have these services in Syria? When the Vietnamese arrived. did they complain? Everyone has to earn his/her keep. There is no such thing as free lunch, even in this country.As an immigrant myself, my family has never had welfare checks, But we have pride!
