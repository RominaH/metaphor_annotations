Personal responsibility is a 'white' enterprise that the clans do not accept, and our corrupt social welfare system, which rewards for large families and other dysfunctions, aggravates the problem of unwanted children. The natives must save face whatever the cost to the environment, and our social welfare system is a willing accomplice.Winnipeg is a welfare hell. Mountains of resources squandered on drugs, junk food, weapons, puposelessness in general. And the legal aid lawyers, social workers, doctors and nurses, remedial teachers and 'poverty' advocates are doing very well.  Just put the problem back to society, it can always charge the bill on its special white god credit card. Party on!
