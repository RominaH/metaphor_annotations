You make sound like a bad thing that we allowed there refugees into Canada. In the mid 1950's my family migrated from the east coast at a time when my parents could not raise their family of six. We lived in a three room basement apartment for three years. MY two sister's did not arrive for many months after we got to Toronto. There was no money to pay the train fare. But we were eventually all able to live under one roof in our three bedroom apt.My father could not read nor write but he worked very hard and managed to land a unionized job. After 3 years we were able to purchase a small house in East York. WE all went to school and got an education with one of us graduating from university.I truly feel for these refugees and hope we can bring more to Canada. Remember in the words of John F. Kennedy '.....ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country....'
