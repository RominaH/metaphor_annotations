The shallowness of this debate on government finances is depressing and all three parties are in the dock, along with an inadequately informed citizenry. We all ask to be manipulated because it so obviously works.Fact is government has little influence on the broader economy. Harper is no more responsible for our current doldrums than he would be if were enjoying a nice pleasant 3% growth rate. Indeed, if Harper can control the economy then why did we have a downturn? Truth is he can't.Nor can Trudeau or Mulcair. Why we assign our political leaders influence on this is beyond me.However, it is quite normal in times of economic downturns for governments to run deficits so as to alleviate the problem to a degree. Cutting spending in order to have a balanced budget in such circumstances makes things worse as every economist knows.Fact is, we all like things for free - limitless government services, no taxes and unicorn rides for all.Harper deceptions on this file, as on so many others, has rendered reasoned debate nearly impossible. Standby for complete rubbish from our 'economist' PM on Thursday night.
