More left-wing garbage spewed by the Globe.  To wit:'It means America's allies are left with questions about where they stand.'  Umm, Globe editorialists, haven't you noticed yet that Syria is in shambles, and that Obama's 'pivot' to Asia is invisible?'It means the Great Wall of Mexico is on the table.'  Yeah, right.Can the Globe's editorialists possibly become more juvenile, pedantic, idiotic and whiney?
