I watched a CBC TV piece a few nights ago on a Syrian family sponsored by the residents of Advocate Harbour Nova Scotia, a town described as being in decline sticking out into the middle of end of the Bay of Fundy. One resident had opened up an unoccupied home and I believe the community had raised $17,000 in a month and is trying to encourage the family to stay, but the father is trained as a tailor...Wikipedia in part offers of Advocate Harbour, 'The community is situated on Route 209 and has a small well-protected fishing harbour opening on the Bay of Fundy; the harbour dries at low tide. The community's economy is tied to the seasonal industries of fishing and tourism.'This morning's Globe and Mail announces that the 'The Liberal government has quietly approved changes aimed at helping Atlantic Canadian seafood processors that will allow them to bring in unlimited numbers of low-skilled temporary foreign workers to fill seasonal jobs this year'.25,000 Syrian refugees to date, 55,000 more Syrian refugees in 2016, unlimited low-skilled temporary foreign workers...one sponsored Syrian family without any work in Advocate Harbour NS...is there at least a partial disconnect here?I'm not suggesting for a moment that we funnel Syrian Refugees to Atlantic Canada as indentured workers in the Seafood industry, but has anyone thought of asking them if anyone is interested in the opportunity?
