If it appears racially motivated in any sense that is China's fault because they have no significant component of their population that are of non-Chinese ancestry. Tell you what China develop the racial diversity so readily apparent in North America and then the tax won't look so racially motivated. If you choose to stay so insular that's your own fault. As it is the tax applies to everyone not just people in China.
