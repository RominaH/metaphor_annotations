I feel your pain, Marie, and your anger. It was all set up by an uninformed press and pollsters who could not reach the silent underbelly of abiding american prejudice and ignorance. Also, please note the demographics: young women, both black and white, and other millennials voted against Hillary. And there was her record. And there was Comey, who has much to answer for. So your own advice is good: 'I will get over the election.' So will we all. There are males who are as bitterly disappointed in the result as you are. Don't think that your sex gives you a monopoly on resentment. And don't forget Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May in Britain. The time will come. There is the future. But what is needed is a female candidate with absolutely impeccable credentials. Good as she was, and ripe as the time was, Hillary was not without taint or blemish. There will be a next time. In the vast sweep of history, four years is a mere blip. It will happen, it is worth waiting for, and you don't need to waste your vitriol on the Hillary case, which (let's face it) was a contest between dubious characters. The Big Win, when it comes, will be all the more impressive and valuable when there is NO doubt at all.
