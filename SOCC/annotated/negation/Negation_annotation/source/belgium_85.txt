Thanks very much for your reassurance, Richard! 

I went back and revised my post somewhat because I thought I sounded angry, cold and possibly insulting (which I probably was)...but I didn't intend to include anything religious, Muslim or anything, at any time. 

I do recognize, however, that it is entirely possibly the Belgian police officer demonstrated racial prejudice by believing I was north African and therefore should be followed, harassed, etc. Racial prejudice is widespread, and not only in Belgium. 

I honestly meant absolutely nothing religious, though!
