A national border is an imaginary line on the surface of the earth demarcating the territory within which groups of people choose to do things in different ways. For example, the 49th parallel is one such line dividing one group of people to the north who govern themselves as a constitutional monarchy and agree to strict firearm regulation, from a republic to the south that considers similar regulation to be unreasonable.Within our borders, Canada has the right to act in it's own citizens' best interest - citizens of all races and faiths, I will point out. This might be in trade deals preventing Europeans from dumping subsidized foods, vetting people arriving from known world 'hotspots', investigating Russian organized crime, as well as stemming Chinese speculation in housing.It is not anti Chinese/European/Russian/American to be pro-Canada. It is simply what being an independent country entails.
