I think Canada will need to think carefully about its previous support for the Clinton and Obama agendas. It will be very difficult to engage in an immigration policy that ignores the dangers of radical Islam. By pushing such a policy, Canada could seriously risk its trading relationship and access to the US. As for green policies, Canada is free to do what it wants there because the decision to use resources well and to design for this is not something the US would meddle with. The more dopey aspects of the Trudeau agenda will need to be grounded in reality.
