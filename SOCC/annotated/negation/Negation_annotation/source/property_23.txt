Frankly, I prefer the (majority of the) Chinese to the English settlers many of whom perpetuated the classist attitudes and hierarchical divisions of the UK. The current wave of Chinese migrants are well-educated and contribute to Canadian life on multiple levels just like their earlier forebears. They just don't wave a flag and jump up and down while they're at it. Like everyone else they just want to quietly assimilate and get on with it.
