Clinton was going to be good because Bernie supported her, but now I think I was wrong and Trump was the good option. The Democrats had two terms to work and get something done, they did what they could, that was enough of them for now. Either one was a win for the US and Canada, but I will miss seeing the possible Bernie policies, those are the ones we should look at adopting in Canada, less Bernie was the loss if anything. Read up on those Bernie policies people, we need to let our MPs know that is what we want. But no more globalist policies, diversity and multiculturalism policies in Canada, we've had enough of that nonsense abusive globalist agenda; we already have diversity in Canada, that box has been checked-off long ago, no more living in the past, we have had enough. We have more important mountains to climb like jobs and the economy that benefit all Canadians.
