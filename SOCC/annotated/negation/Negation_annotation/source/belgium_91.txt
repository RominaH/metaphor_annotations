The question is whether it's the seeds or the soil. Is it the immigrants themselves, or the poor environment in which they are planted? I think everyone can agree that dumping a bunch of ill-prepared foreigners into suburban European ghettos is a bad idea, but that shouldn't minimize the agency and autonomy of those individuals. Radicalization, while pernicious, is a ultimately a choice; Islamic terrorism is not simply the product of bad immigration policies. We must be careful to acknowledge, yet not conflate, the two issues.
