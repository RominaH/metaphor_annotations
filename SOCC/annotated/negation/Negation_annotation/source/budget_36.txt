Harper and his govt are liars and cheaters, they have been since they came to power, we are not gullible enough to believe them on this surprise surplus announcement. The Conservatives have been a detriment to Canada, bad for our reputation worldwide, uncaring, self-absorbed, we must vote them out of office. How intelligent are those that still think Harper could be anything more then he's been over the last two terms, petty, vindictive, tyrannical, and terrible at managing our country.
