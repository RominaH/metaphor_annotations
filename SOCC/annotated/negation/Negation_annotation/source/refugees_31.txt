I was watching BBC World's Hardtalk program last night featuring an interview with Lebanon's education minister.He was explaining how Lebanon is trying to cope with 1.5 million refugees from Syria.He also explained how the Lebanese govt had to be very cautious because the Lebanese government estimates that up to 2% of the refugees coming to Lebanon are in fact Islamic terrorists.Now consider if 2% of the 1.1 million refugees arrived in Germany last year are Islamic terrorists (no reason to believe the number is not realistic) then you have more than 20,000 Islamic terrorists arrived in Germany last year.Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Belgium are very 'happy' European countries. In fact they are the best countries in the world, according to an article in yesterday's newspaper.But what happens when there's another Islamic Charlie Hebdo or Paris attack.We all know it's only a matter of time.After that, 'happiness' index will depend on the maintenance of very strict security and much more surveillance.
