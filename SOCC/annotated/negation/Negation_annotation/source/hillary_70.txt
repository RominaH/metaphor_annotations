Ms. Henein is a brilliant lawyer and well her opinion piece was well written she missed so many other subtleties.  Many minorities did not like Hillary.  They saw her as an entitled white woman.  Read the Detroit papers if you don't think so.  It's not something the defeated want to discuss or address, but they know it and will never admit it.  If they came out in force as to what they did for Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012, this opinion would not be in electronic print. No, I don't like Donald Trump but neither do I like Hillary Clinton.  Gender had nothing to do with it and your path to shattering the glass ceiling certainly does not rest with Hillary Clinton.  It may have been shattered decades ago.  You only have to look.
