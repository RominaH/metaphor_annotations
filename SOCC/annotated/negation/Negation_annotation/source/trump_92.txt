The republicans did the blindside to the democrats, took the media with them; they never saw it coming. Now trump said he liked keystone what oil man in the US wouldn't, I am not a fan of selling our highly discounted crude to the US. JT stand up and get our pipelines built so Trump will not need keystone and pass a law immediately making it a capital crime to sell Canada oil for any less than the world price per barrel. Do it quick before the new president gets up and running his game, because rest assured you are only on the field to be blindsided.
