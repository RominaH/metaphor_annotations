Ms Henein assumes that a woman's vote should always and only be decided by its effects for the equality of women.  Surely that idea sees them as something less than fully equal citizens, with opinions on the major issues that confront any sovereign state, economic, cultural, and foreign policy.But Ms Henein is right that a long struggle lies ahead.  It always has, and one setback will not matter much in the end.

Achieving that is most profound social change imaginable, and it won't come easily.
