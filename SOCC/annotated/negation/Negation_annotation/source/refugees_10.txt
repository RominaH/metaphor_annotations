A thoughtful and well written piece by Ms Al-Fattal. However, there is one important aspect missing: The lack of shown interest, desire, national pride in Syrians wanting to stay and fight for their country. Throughout history, we've seen examples of mass migrations of refugees always with the intent of return to their homeland. The Syrian case does not seem to follow this pattern and the one way ticket to Europe/Canada for economic benefit is having adverse effects in creating resentment to their plight.
