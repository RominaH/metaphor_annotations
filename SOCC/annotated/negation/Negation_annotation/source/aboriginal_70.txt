Wow.  It seems commenters here have little knowledge of what is actually going on in FN communities.  You want to know why there are issues within families?  Well current parents were not raised by parents.  They were raised by a residential school system that abused them horribly.  How on earth could they learn to be parents?  Now they struggle siginficantly with the trauma from their past as well as trying to learn what normal parent-child relationships look like.  This is why lots of FN kids are being raised by other family members like grandparents.The systemic racism that is faced by the FN popuation is very real.  THe challenges faced by FN youth are also very real.
