I honestly cannot for the life of me understand how a UBC professor can be this unintelligent? It was called a CHINESE head tax. Is it called a Chinese Foreign Buyer tax? This man should absolutely not be teaching at UBC let alone writing an opinion piece like this. It's time to quit your victim mentality Henry, and grow up. I feel bad for your students.
