So let me get this straight. Harper should get zero credit for managing the post-2008 recession because things just naturally rose back up and it had nothing to do with 'economic stewardship' but he should get all the blame for the current recession (albeit by the smallest of margins) and that it must be the result of of his lack of economic stewardship.And of course he is completely to blame for Ontario's problems because I guess 10+ years of McGuinty and Wynne had nothing to do with it. The record debt, deficit, and reduction in credit rating is all on Stephen.Is that about the size of it?And when Kathleen Wynne stops injecting herself into the Federal election discussion, I will stop mentioning the Liberal 'economic stewardship' of Ontario when discussing the Federal election.
