Or maybe Hillary simply didn't have a very good campaign, had the wrong advisers, and, like all candidates, had certain flaws that her opponents went after?I was struck by the fact she frequently reminded people ('I'm with Her') that SHE was running for President. How often did Barack Obama remind people in 2008 that HE was BLACK? The people who were going to vote for her 'because she was a woman' didn't needed to be reminded. And for the rest of the population? It probably didn't matter for most of them. And her final rallies with Hollywood and music stars? I wonder if these didn't do more harm than good in those 'Fly Over' places where most people felt forgotten?
