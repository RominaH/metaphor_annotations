On all of the articles on Trump's victory the comment boards are awash with glowing tributes to his victory. I question whether these commentators have actually read his policy statements or listened to what he had to say about major issues that concern us all. I question whether they have looked up who Trump has picked for senior cabinet posts. For those who thought Bush and Cheney were the worst thing to happen to America, they couldn't at that time foresee a Trump election. None of the snake-oil pitches made by him to fix the economy will come to pass, but he has succeeded in doing what might have seemed impossible only a few days ago. He has managed to make the world a much more dangerous place, while more then likely plunging the world into a recession.   When you make stupid decisions and they have no consequence it only matters to yourself. When you consciously vote in a man uniquely unqualified to be president , then those voters must also wear the stupid hat. Sadly we all pay the price for American stupidity and the seemingly trancelike state they must have been in to believe in the nonsense they were fed. Buyers remorse will set in quickly, but there is no return for 4 years, and by then the damage will be done.
