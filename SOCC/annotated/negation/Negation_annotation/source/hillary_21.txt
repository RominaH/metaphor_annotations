Dear Marie, just fyi, Hillary performed modestly among women, and poorly among white women in particular. So much for the sisterhood.Hillary lost because she was a bad candidate, and the wrong candidate for the times, when voters were thirsting for something new and exciting, and wanted change. This had nothing to do with gender.And calling half of Trump supporters a 'basket of deplorables', and effectively writing off the rural and blue-collar voters who ultimately propelled Trump to victory, was a disastrous mistake.
