Everyone is still missing the point of what the Apple Watch is:It's fashion. It is by definition of no utility. Watches have been more fashion than function for as long as they've been worn. Anyone remember paying $50 for a Swatch that cost $2 to make?The Apple Watch actually offers quite a bit of utility as far as wrist adornments go, but it is first and foremost something to look good. It was never meant to replace an iPhone so people need to stop evaluating it on that basis.As for rapid, pervasive obsolescence of your latest gadget, it's an unfortunate side-effect of Moore's Law. You don't have to buy the latest and greatest if you don't want to, but a lot of people want to.I will likely end up with an Apple Watch for the following ironic reason:I haven't worn a watch in years because I have had a phone in my pocket that already does the one thing a watch does: tell time. Now, with an Apple Watch, I'll get the convenience of telling the time without having to get a hand free to get my phone out of my pocket and still have a device that gives me access to much of the stuff I turn to my iPhone for already.It really does make sense if you put it in the right perspective.
