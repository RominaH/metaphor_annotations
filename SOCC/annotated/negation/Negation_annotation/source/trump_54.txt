It is a very sad day for progressives everywhere in the world.  Good Editorial by the Globe.  You nailed it.  Trump is unfit for office, however 47.5% of Americans voted for him which is enough to elect him as President.It feels good to be a Canadian today.  Can you imagine what it must be like for passionate Democrats today?
