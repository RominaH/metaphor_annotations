I'll be the first to agree that there should be an inquiry. But I tried to google information on missing and dead aboriginal men. Guess what? Not a single hit. Now one would think it's pretty safe to say that as members of the same communities as these women, there would be at least some information. None? Nada? Nyet? Non?
