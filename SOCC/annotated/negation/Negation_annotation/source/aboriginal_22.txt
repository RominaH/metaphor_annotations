Great job identifying the self obvious problems with abuse of native women and children but a failing grade on proposing solutions.The big picture is that we will have increasing native social problems as long as the reserve system of segregation remains.  It always surprises me to see otherwise intelligent people prepared to tinker around the edges of  native ills but never suggest the whole system is broken and that Native leadership are the prime drivers of maintaining the status quo.Visit a reserve, see for yourself the conditions and then tell me how a people who are dependent on a band and council for everything without any expectation of personal responsibility for ones living can work. Time for a change, become Canadian, get a job, pay taxes. This is the solution but will never happen as long as the native segregation exists.
