These Cons - announce money to be spent several times by the Economic Action promotion machine - the same money btw, to the tune of 3/4 of a billion in a crass vote getting program, then by stealth tell departments to not spend it all, then announce that we have a surplus in a crass vote getting program. These folks don't govern - they politic 24-7, wait, to which they have a media program with that very name ... and the cost? Throw them to the curb.
