'He’s hardly the choice of the establishment, media, cultural, business or political. That includes the establishment of his own Republican party, which had been predicting – and quietly hoping – that his leadership would lead to a defeat of cataclysmic proportions'Yes, this was entirely the point as many tried to point out, but were drowned out by accusations of racism and sexism. For me? It doesn't matter who is president. 8 years of Bush and 8 years of Obama, 8 years of Clinton before that, and what has really changed? Not much. I'm just a little guy. But I am going to love watching all the opinion makers, politicians, pundits and media talking heads wring their hands and fret and worry. I'm going to love watching all the big business Wall Street types who poured millions and millions into Hillary's war chest, thinking they bought their candidate and had it in the bag pull their hair out.  They all took the people for granted and abused them, then belittled them and insulted them when they tried to protest. Well  the people bit back.
