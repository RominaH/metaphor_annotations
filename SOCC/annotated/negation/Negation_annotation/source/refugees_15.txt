Before the author volunteers more money for the Syrian Refugee crisis perhaps she should report on the fate of Canada's senior citizens. The Canadian governments treatment of the 'oldest' of Canada's senior citizens,, those with serious neurodegenerative conditions should not go unnoted. I have seen the facilities which house many of Canada's older generation. You only need to walk through one of these places, or speak to the spouse who must give up their own family home because the shared pension is now diverted to a poorly run facility, to see that money is desperately needed!!! I am so tired of seeing Canada's new government pat themselves on the back when so many of it's own citizens are in desperate straits.
