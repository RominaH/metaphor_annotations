Hilary did not lose because she was a woman. She lost because the US had their version of an Arab Spring. A restless electorate wanted an outsider. It is unfortunate that Trump was the one to tap into that movement. Bernie nearly defeated Hilary by calling for a revolution. Meanwhile Hilary was the typical establishment candidate who had become wealthy through pay to play.   Hilary and her spokespersons certainly played the woman card often enough but Hilary's enthusiastic response to Madeline Allbright's declaration of a special place in hell for women who would not vote for women was a mistake. That backfired with younger women who see themselves as able to compete on merit alone. In the end Hilary probably got as many votes because she was a woman as she lost for the same reason.
