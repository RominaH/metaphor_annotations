At most the city should buy back all exisitng licences for the cost it currently charges for a new licence, 4.5 grand, less admin fee. That is the most the city should compensate licence holders for, because that is the actual cost of a licence! Then, as the globe said the city should simply charge all drivers a yearly permit where they also have to show car maintenance and insurance. Done. This should be like 100 or so.
