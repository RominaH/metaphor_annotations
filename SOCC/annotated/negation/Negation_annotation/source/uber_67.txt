Not a fan of Uber, sliding scale rates, lack of regulation re someone taking me somewhere, etc.  However, that's my opinion.  This editorial states there aren't enough cabs in the city - a rather glaring mistake. Possibly in outlying areas it may take longer to get a cab, but that would be true of Uber as well.  But I don't appreciate the media trying to make up my mind for me by providing misinformation.
