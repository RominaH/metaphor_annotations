For a history professor who purportedly is an expert in this area, he missed some Canadian history. One of the key reasons private property is not a Charter Right is because provinces in the 1980s were worried about foreign, at that time, American and Germans buying up shorelines and farmland, locking out local populations. They wanted to have the right to impose a tax to curb foreign buyers. Ontario, PEI and a few others implemented a tax to curb outside buyers from purchasing property in their respective provinces. The BC tax is nothing new and, if history is any guide, will only last a for a few years until the market cools and prices start dropping dramatically.
