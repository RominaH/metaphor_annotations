If it happens once in a while to everyone, it's a crime. If it happens disproportionately to a particular demographic, it's more than just a crime.Harper is way out to lunch on this one. This is not an issue the police can solve. It's going to take a society, a country, to do that, and that takes leadership and information. It is time to have an inquiry, gather the information, consult the experts across all the areas of concern, and formulate and implement a national strategy.It won't be easy. In fact, it will be difficult and contentious. The easiest thing to do is just dismiss the notion right now and brush it off, which is exactly what Harper is doing. Which is exactly all he has ever done!
