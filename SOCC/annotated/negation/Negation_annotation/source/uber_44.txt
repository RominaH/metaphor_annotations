I understand that the taxi system is broken ($100,000+ for a license plate is ludicrous) and for sure needs fixing but suggesting that we drive with total strangers not unlike hitchhiking seems very unsafe for these reasons: 1) taxis are inspected more rigorously, 2) taxis are insured, 3) taxi drivers are safety and CPR trained, 4) taxi drivers must pass a background check . My family does not hitch hike and I honestly don't see the difference between hitch hiking and Uber. I just signed up with Uber and it took less than 15 min only requiring photo uploads of documents and licenses. No verification of these documents. I just don't feel safe until there is some sort of regulation ... also this broken system is not the fault of the individuals who have paid their fees, passed the tests and have committed to serve the city and its patrons. I don't think on a whim just anyone should be able to drive people around. Background checks. insurance and safety training are a minimum requirement.
