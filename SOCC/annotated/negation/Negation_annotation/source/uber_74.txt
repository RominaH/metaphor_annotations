Refreshing editorial!  So nice for someone to call it like it is.  Why should I have to pay more to get a ride in an old smelly car?  What makes it worse is despite my paying inflated rates the person driving the car is likely not making much money - its the license holder! Uber offers one form of competition, hopefully more will follow.On another (but related) note.  Hypothetically: If cabs cost double what they do now would there be more or less impaired driving?  Now the real point: What would happen if cabs cost half what they do now, more or less impaired driving?
