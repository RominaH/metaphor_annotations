I am a conservative but have to say Harper is doing a last ditch effort to stop the slide in the polls for his party. Coming out with a BS surplus by clawing back funds from gov departments and calling it a surplus to gain image is deception at its best. A trick used by the insurance industry using satellite offices to send money back and forth in order to justify raising rates. Now for the first time we have the Feds in Canada doing it. SAD and dirty that is.
