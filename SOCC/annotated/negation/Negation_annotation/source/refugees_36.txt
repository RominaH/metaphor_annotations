Its a big world and Canada can't fix all the problems. You want these refugees to find homes, lobby larger nations, with more resources. You might also knock on the door of the neighbors in the ME, they might want to help their own a bit. Of course, maybe China would have some interest in this folk, they have a thriving economy...maybe?
