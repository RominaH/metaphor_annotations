I can't help but notice that the writer of this article has an Arabic name.  She is a part time professor of Arabic politics. This should not however prevent her from tryingto understand the dilemmas of the West to handle this massive influx of refugees from a conflict between rivalling ideologies in Syria primarily.  Sweden, Germany, allor Europe and Canada as well are living through difficult economic times since 2007.The situation for domestic populations in those countries aren't perfect either.  Fewborn and bred Europeans have easy access to higher education, housing, social support, subsidized daycare spots.  Those things have never been just served up ona silver platter even for those who have paid very high taxes all their lives.  This goesfor Canada as well.  We cannot as countries fix all the difficulties for these refugees with one swift move ofa magic wand.  We cannot accept an unsurmountable number of refugees when so manywho already live here are struggling with unemployment, lack of cheap daycare or access to free health and dental care.  Our political system is not fool proof even if itseems a better one than the one in Syria.  We live with a situation that is not going to be solved over night.  And it will certainlynot happen any faster if we just open the flood gates and let the masses arrive.  Andit's not going to solve anything long term if the same needs for our own nativepopulations aren't being attended to with the same determination.
