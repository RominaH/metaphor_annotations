Because you can't just go to city hall and get a license to operate a cab company like you would for a pet license, drivers license, etc. The supply of these licenses is artificially restricted, and that's a huge part of the problem.City hall needs to get out of the way and allow the free market to take over. For sure, they can set reasonable standards to prevent abuses - and some of the tactics of uber, like surge pricing during a terrorist attack certainly are abusive - but these standards need not include an artificial limit on the number of taxis on the road.
