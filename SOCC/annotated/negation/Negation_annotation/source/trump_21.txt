America has done itself, and the world, an enormous self-inflicted injury.Choices have consequences.At a time when the world is facing aggressive and highly motivated totalitarian powers, and enormous international challenges on climate change, ...... the US has just elected Wendell Wilkie and the America Firsters instead of FDR....It takes a special level of wishful thinking to believe that the leaders of China and Russia, and a host of other unsavory despots, will not take advantage of this terrible error.This result is the outcome of thirty years, and more, of failure to defend the integrity of the institutions of democracy.It matters that Wyoming has the same power in the Senate as California.It matters that old-age mortality is a bigger threat to incumbent congressmen than the ballot box.It matters who sits on the Supreme Court and makes decisions on electoral spending, or on gerrymandered congressional boundaries, or on critical provisions of the Voting Rights Act.It matters that the fairness standard apply to all electioneering media.It matters that minority voters not have to stand two or three hours in line to vote, or that Greensboro N.C. not have its advanced polling stations cut from 18 to one.It matters that organised religion be kept out of the electoral process - no group has done more to bring this catastrophe about than evangelical Christians, and their obsession with abortion.It matters in a thousand different ways.Polarisation is driven by the deliberate exploitation of the long known weaknesses of first-past-the-post.  That ground was prepared and the seeds were planted a long, long time before Donald Trump ever decided to run for office.He is merely an opportunist who jumped to the front of the line, in the right place, and at the right time......Perhaps the Globe will finally understand why electoral reform in general, and most particularly abolition of first-past-the-post, is the most urgent priority.
