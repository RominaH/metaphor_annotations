The license has nothing to do with almost any argument,,, it is simply distracting you from the real truth,,, Uber drivers have no insurance,, they neither collect or pay HST as they are required by law, there are 83 more by-laws, cameras, safety issues overcharging,,, that Uber is not regulated are we kidding ourselves,,, getting in a car with no insurance is enough to stop me,,
