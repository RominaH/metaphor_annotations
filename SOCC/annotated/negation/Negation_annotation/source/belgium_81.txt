So, Gagnon says that the 'Flemmings speak a Dutch dialect'. Well, then, I guess Gagnon does not mean to suggest that those non-Dutch Belgians speak some lesser form of The Dutch Language, and so she is very happy to also assert that the Quebecois speak some French dialect, hence that the Quebecois appear to have the enunciation of a Metro announcement. As Oscar Wilde would put it: France and Quebec have many things in common, but the language is not one of them. Tres bien!
