I think the Globe and Mail should concentrate on what Trump's victory means for the Globe and Mail. I have never seen a paper give such poor coverage to a political candidate. For the last year, it has been nothing but ridicule, dismissiveness, and a foregone conclusion that he would be defeated. In doing so, this paper has misled the reader and we now are in a position of knowing nothing about the new President. This paper failed in its fundamental responsibility of reporting the truth. It has been a year of propaganda from nearly every reporter covering the American election as well as from the editors. As a subscriber of this epaper, I feel a certain sense of betrayal of the G&M's overlooking the truth. Factual reporting sacrificed to make a political point. Shame on this paper and those who work for it.
