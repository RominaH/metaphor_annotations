Is someone here suggesting that there are some cohesive group of anti-aboriginal psychotic murderers out there whose collective mission statement is to kill only young aboriginal women? Because if nobody is suggesting that then this is just another murder where someone was at the WRONG PLACE at the WRONG TIME. If too many young aboriginal women are THERE and THEN, it seems, the reason for that should be the subject of any inquiry.
