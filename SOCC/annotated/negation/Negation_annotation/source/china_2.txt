' So with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's coming visit to China, we look west to a China-dominated Asia-Pacific region to build our prosperity and refocus Canada's foreign policy'The PRC negotiating team for the upcoming Canada-PRC free trade agreement must be cracking their ribs trying to contain their laughter. It's going to be a stand up comedy show with PRC having a lop sided advantage holding all the cards. Basically PRC will demand what China wants and the baffled and befuddled Canadians will have to comply or else for example PRC will threaten to stop capital outflows of private cash to Canada which is all that is propping up the hyperinflating Canadian RE industry and Canadian Banks. If PRC imposed outflow restrictions to Canada then 25% of Canada's fragile economy based on housing would implode. I can't believe China thinks so little of Trudeau...unbelievable....they must think he's some kind of empty headed Vogue poser who takes selfies, elbows people and tells everyone 'yes' or something ....
