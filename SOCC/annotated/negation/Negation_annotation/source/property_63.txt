No, Henry, it's not a new head tax. The New head tax is the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program. I didn't read about your opposition to the QIIP. The head tax was $8,000 each, in today's equivalent dollars. The QIIP is $800,000 as a loan, effectively $200,000 or more in opportunity cost to the immigrant over 5 years. That's 25 times the value of the earlier head tax!
