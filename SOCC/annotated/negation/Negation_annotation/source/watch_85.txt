While technology does march on, sometimes it takes a few backwards steps towards true progress. Case in point are the ipads and tablets which I see as little more than toys for the easily distracted. While tablets are today's rage that have led to the nosediving of the laptop, anyone who has used these new devices knows all to well their limitations. Trying to compose an email on a ipad is like communicating in morse code or sending a telegram circa 1913. The same goes for the smartwatch which does not even have GPS, which every cheap digital camera has, big mistake. But what do I know, I'm a geezer and still tell the time by a watch with a face.
