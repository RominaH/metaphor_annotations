well it is targeted at the chinese but it picks up other groups as well because it would be unacceptable to frame legislation against the chinese specifically.The real story here is though that the Provincial government waited until the last possible moment in the run up to the election to 'do something'. And the Canadian banks have been selling mortgages offshore for years to foreign buyers so that housing and renting is unaffordable. So much for being part of the community.
