Trump now IS the President of the United States. The people have spoken. I have faith in the American people to elect the right president for the time. We as Canadians can opinionate all we like but it is the American living the American experience with all of its issues, pressures and opportunities that chooses. With all of those nuances and keeping in mind their unforgiving campaigns I would trust them to choose wisely the president they need no matter who won tonight.
