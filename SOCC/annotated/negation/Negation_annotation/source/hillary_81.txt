Quite frankly, if someone is in the country illegally, they should be deported. They should follow proper channels for entry. If you want that to change, change the laws, but you shouldn't support the willful breaking of the law.Aside from that, the US has the technology to determine when companies are hiring illegal immigrants and fine those companies. Those companies should be fined. They are not helping the illegal immigrants out, they are exploiting them, and in doing that they are exploiting the lower income population by increasing the workforce base and stopping wage pressures from building.
