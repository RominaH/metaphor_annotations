If, and that's a very big if, Trump travels to Moscow to repair relations with Russia and orders the US's military, FBI, CIA, JSOC, etc. to stop the US's regime-change operations in Syria and the rest of the world, and to stop supporting the US's Nuland-installed puppet government in Ukraine, the 'Canadian' government and all of the MSM of the US's vassal states are going to be placed in a very interesting situation.  For example, what are Justine and Harjit going to say to the thoroughly-brainwashed Canadian herd should Trump order changes to US foreign policy such as the above? Whatever it is, government-propaganda-distribution outfits such as the G&M will, as they  have been so religiously been doing, will leap into action and 'condition' the masses to accept and support it. One thing I've learned over my many decades of life is how quickly the 'direction' of the bewildered herd can be turned to whatever direction the US corporate Elite desire. One thing is for sure, before Trump takes office, all of the G&M editorial staff and writers will have to take some 're-education' courses in creative writing, because insulting a newly elected president of the US of A and everyone who voted for him will not be a good long-term business model.
