Ah, Ms. Wente is (1) a conservative and (2) I'm pretty sure wasn't raised a Catholic. The pope is expressing some liberal ideas that stick in her craw, fair enough. Personally, I think there's a number of things going on. Pope Francis is doing a great PR job for the church without really deviating from the Church's overall theological position. The church needs some recharging, and he's doing his best to provide it without deviating from core theology. He was a priest and bishop in South America, and saw a kind of poverty there that few popes (all Europeans, and until recently, all from Italy) have ever seen. Christianity - for all the focus the Church has placed on these things in the past few decades - was not meant to be about sexual orientation, abortion issues, and other modern day preoccupations. Its original imperative was about love and compassion, with a strong injunction to help the poor, as well as a focus on the life of the spirit versus the material. In focusing on poverty and questioning the rampant materialism of the modern age, he's going back to the roots of the religion (sadly mostly lost in the last 2000 years). As for environmentalism, why not? This I think is part of the great PR he's doing, there's nothing controversial about it from the Church's perspective, and it's a very hot topic these days. Whether he (or the Church) are really embracing it is anyone's guess.
