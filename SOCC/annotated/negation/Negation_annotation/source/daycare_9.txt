It's easy to complain about the cost of a government program, but that cost must be measured against its benefits. Fighter planes and ships are expensive too, but we know we need them. Let's get the best benefit for the expenditures.Government programs aren't wrong. All governments tax and spend. it's what they spend the tax money on and how we all benefit that are at issue.I think many Canadians have seen their taxes spent without getting enough benefit from them. They want their hard lives to get easier, not harder, and they want Canada to progress too.We've heard enough focus on macro-economic things like 'the economy', 'the stock market', and 'debt-to-income ratios'. These things matter only to people who have more money than they can spend. It's micro-economic things like 'How do I feed my kids?', and 'How do I pay my mortgage?' that most matter to most Canadians.
