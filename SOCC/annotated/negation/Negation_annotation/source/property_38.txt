I live in the City of Richmond, B.C. - 26% of the buyers of real estate in my city in the month before the tax was imposed were foreign.  One only has to look around at the signs on new development to determine who is being targeted for the sale of new properties. However, apparently 50% of the households of Richmond do not have any reported income in Canada and therefore do not pay any provincial and federal tax.  Who pays for the infrastructure that is the fabric of Canada?  Who pays for all of the social benefits? Is there any wonder there is an issue?  I realize that one can become entrenched behind the walls of academia, but perhaps the Professor can explain why it is acceptable that the cost of the first year of a Commerce degree at UBC is $7538.70 for a resident, while an international student pays $36,519.90 - a 'tax' of 484% per year?  If the Professor is looking to pinpoint racism and discrimination, he may wish to start with his own employer.
