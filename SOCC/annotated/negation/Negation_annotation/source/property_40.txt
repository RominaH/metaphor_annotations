I notice the author doesn't answer his own question. Probably because the answer is clearly NO. A yes answer would be indefensible so he would rather leave it unanswered an imply that maybe it is yes.It is clearly no because it applies to all foreigners and it is clearly no because Chinese Canadians do not have to pay it. I expect better from a UBC Prof than attempting to stir up racial grevances.
