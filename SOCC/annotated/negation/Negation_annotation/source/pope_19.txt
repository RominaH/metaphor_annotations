Really, calling down the pope, a guy that has expressed humility in ways we haven't seen from a religious leader (the Dhali Lhama excepted) in decades.   Of course he is not perfect, which is to say, he is not perfectly aligned with your values.  By all accounts he is genuine and his heart is in the right place.  He is the leader of an institution that is inherently conservative and must be dealing with some challenging political opposition from within the church.  With that in mind, realistically, what more do you want from this guy?
