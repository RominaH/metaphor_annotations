I would add that they need to ensure that minimum safety standards -- for riders and drivers -- are met. For example, safety shields, operational seatbelts and possibly speed governors. Drivers should also be required to have training in first aid and be able to speak fluent English (or French, where that is the predominant language.) Right now Uber is a little too wild west.Otherwise the market will just drive prices down until enough players drop out and the one's with big cashpiles (like Uber who've made their money skirting the rules everyone else has to play by) will consolidate and jack up prices.But mostly it's a safety thing. For the rider and driver. The last thing we need is to ratchet down more incomes while the fat cats skim the cream off of the worker's labour.
