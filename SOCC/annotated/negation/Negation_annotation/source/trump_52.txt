Instead of providing fact based news and insightful balanced and fair analysis - they incessantly bullied their readers with biased commentary. If Globe readers are frightened of the prospects of a Trump Presidency that fear is exactly what the mainstream media wanted to achieve. If the Globe failed to grasp the depth of support for Trump across rural USA that is because its writers did not look closely enough at the facts. If Globe writers are asking themselves why this outcome is so different than what they wanted it is because these writers don't carry nearly the influence they think they do.
