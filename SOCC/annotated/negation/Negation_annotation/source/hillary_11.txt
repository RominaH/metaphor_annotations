Another clueless column from the liberals. Women do not identify with Clinton - she is a wealthy elitist who has nothing in common with ordinary women and as the election shows, ordinary women did not line up to support her. The writer is clueless when she believes this election was about mysogyny and the alleged glass ceiling (and what top position has Clinton been in for years, hello?). In fact, Clinton is a power hungry, egotistical person who did not recognize that she should have quit after losing to Obama. She had her fair shot and she clearly lost, yet she returned like a zombie and soldiered on with her fake smile and fake personality. She has done enormous damage to the Democrats by not allowing fresh faces to take center stage. Not speaking about Bernie as he is a hopeless extremist. The democrats needed someone on the centre that conservatives would have supported. Instead, Clinton went the opposite direction. The fact that the lib media is unable to face the real reasons behind her loss and unable to learn from this shows how doomed they are. Look around what is happening in the world, wake up and smell the coffee. Change is a'coming.
