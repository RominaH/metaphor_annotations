Despite all media definitely being biased against Trump...he proved ALL MEDIA wrong!!!Why did he win?  Because people are sick of back room deals, lies, and corruption.  The people of America want a president who actually says what every common man is thinking but no one listens...he is not a tutored and schooled politician..he is a man of the people..The media has tried to sway the minds of the people to vote for the media's choice, the politician's choice....the people said otherwise.Does anyone remember a very controversial Canadian Premier...Ralph Klein....media disliked him...the people loved him...he was a man of the people
