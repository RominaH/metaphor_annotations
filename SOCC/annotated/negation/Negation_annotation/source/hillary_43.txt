I have 3 daughters, and I told them that Mrs. Clinton lost because she did not have a platform. If she did, she, and her party, did a poor job explaining it to the masses. The only message that I got from her was that Mr. Trump is not fit to be in office and that she wanted to be the first female President. I honestly believe that she lost because she offered no hope, or direction, to the average American. Mr. Trump, with all his shortcomings, at least offered change and some hope. He now has to make it happen or he will be out of power in 4 years.
