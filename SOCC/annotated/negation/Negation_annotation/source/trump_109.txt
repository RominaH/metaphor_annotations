What did The Globe get wrong?The paper and some of its columnists warned against electing  a man who is a racist, a boor, a sexist. A fraud, who has stiffed thousands of contractors for money and hasn't paid income taxes for decades. A bully who has talked about using nuclear weapons.So he won the election. That doesn't change his moral and character shortcomings.The Globe made the right call. People who think this sleazy salesman is going to bring back America of the 1960s are in for a big surprise. As the saying goes: you can't go back.
