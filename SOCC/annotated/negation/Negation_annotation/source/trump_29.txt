Dear EditorsAt least this is a much more balanced piece than 'the sky is falling' piece you wrote the other day.Here's my view, sitting here in our homeland, not having a vote in the US.Full democracy, allows us all to do and say what we want (short of hatred and racism). My father and uncles, all went to war in WWII to protect that right for all of us today. Most people, in both Canada and the US, have family members who did the same, and some who made the ultimate sacrifice. That America exercised that right yesterday, and other democratic countries have done the same in the past (I am not a fan of Junior Trudeau) is our best strength. As Winston Churchill famously said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.”. None of us have an idea how a Trump Presidency will turn out; but the inescapable fact of the matter is that every American, who wanted to exercise their franchise, had the opportunity yesterday to decide who their President is. It wasn’t all that long ago (Aug 6, 1965), that a guy who many people might have expected wouldn’t support universal suffrage, Lyndon Baines Johnson, passed into law for the US, the Voting Rights Act. In 4 years, if they don’t like his performance, they get to kick Trump out of office. In the meantime, everyone who thinks they are “politically entitled” in the US has a chance to rebuild their favourite system. Just as Lech Walesa upset the communist system in Poland, so today has Donald Trump upset the system of political elites in the USA. This is healthy; this is growth; and this will keep America as the leader of the free world. For a country born of revolution, they have nothing to fear. God bless the United States of America. There couldn’t be a prouder moment to live there.
