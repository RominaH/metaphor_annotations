After reading Ms Turpel-lafond's article, I'm not sure what she is actually asking for. My personal experience living across the street from a reserve is that many of the problems are internal. I watched an 11 or 12 year old girl be sexually assaulted by an older male reserve member and when I called the police, they said they could only attend the reserve if someone on the reserve called.  So I stood there in the rain, yelling at the man who had assaulted the young girl and he told me to mind my own business and go away.  From my perspective, no amount of money will make the problem of abuse of young girls go away until the attitude on the reserves changes. Last week there was an article in the Globe titled 'The best native leader Canada never had.' It profiled Chief Clarence Louie of the Osoyoos band. Unless there has been no residential school abuse of his band, what is the difference between his band and all the other bands?  It seems it is a lack of leadership. Yes, I want this awful abuse to stop happening, but throwing more money at the problem doesn't seem to be the answer.  It has to be a change of culture within each individual band. I've met some really strong native women who know what needs to be done, but they are being undermined by a bad, sexist culture on the reserves. Tossing dollars at the problem won't help. So Ms. Turpel-Lafond, give us something more concrete call to action that just another inquire.  And please tell me why the Osoyoos band works when others do not.
