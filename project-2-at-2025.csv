What I did not like about Clinton the sense I got from her of 'entitlement', that the office was hers for the taking - and not just from her days as Secretary of State, or as a Senator, or from having been First Lady - it struck me, watching a documentary about the US presidential candidates that Clinton had her eyes set on 'the Office' from the time that she had been profiled in LIFE magazine at her College graduation. That uniquely American sense of 'Manifest Destiny' is not attractive - particularly when someone's asking for your help to achieve it. Now that's just my perception, but I believe that same arrogance was what led her (and her team) not to worry about the signals they'd received that they could lose votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Those states were lost by the thinnest of margins, and still, as it has been pointed out, Clinton won the popular vote. I felt that the 'feminist icon' trope was also odd, like a relic from a previous generation. I'm a man, working in a traditional male field (engineering) but I've always accepted and supported my female colleagues and managers. I will agree that the bemused tolerance of the masses was too easily interpreted as tacit approval of Trump's antics, until it was too late. I also agree that groups of people whose attitudes and behaviour sequestered them (rightfully) to an underclass in our society, have been emboldened. I doubt that they will remain that way for long. Nothing that Donald Trump can do will elevate these fools, or make their angry lives truly better. In much the same way, there was nothing that a Clinton victory would REALLY have done to make women's lives better - or guarantee them access to jobs that they would not have earned otherwise.","2024-11-06T03:34:31.455417Z"

found Trump's misogynous tripe repellant, I never gave it much weight in assessing Clinton's loss. What I did not like about Clinton the sense I got from her of 'entitlement', that the office was hers for the taking - and not just from her days as Secretary of State, or as a Senator, or from having been First Lady - it struck me, watching a documentary about the US presidential candidates that Clinton had her eyes set on 'the Office' from the time that she had been profiled in LIFE magazine at her College graduation. That uniquely American sense of 'Manifest Destiny' is not attractive - particularly when someone's asking for your help to achieve it. Now that's just my perception, but I believe that same arrogance was what led her (and her team) not to worry about the signals they'd received that they could lose votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Those states were lost by the thinnest of margins, and still, as it has been pointed out, Clinton won the popular vote. I felt that the 'feminist icon' trope was also odd, like a relic from a previous generation. I'm a man, working in a traditional male field (engineering) but I've always accepted and supported my female colleagues and managers. I will agree that the bemused tolerance of the masses was too easily interpreted as tacit approval of Trump's antics, until it was too late. I also agree that groups of people whose attitudes and behaviour sequestered them (rightfully) to an underclass in our society, have been emboldened. I doubt that they will remain that way for long. Nothing that Donald Trump can do will elevate these fools, or make their angry lives truly better. In much the same way, there was nothing that a Clinton victory would REALLY have done to make women's lives better - or guarantee them access to jobs that they would not have earned otherwise.","2024-11-05T20:31:45.214030Z"

I can't believe Americans rejected Hillary because she was a woman. The American author, philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris explains in one of his podcasts why he thinks Trump won the election. He blames the result to a large extent on American voters' reaction to, and their repudiation of, the left's analysis of the following issues: black/brown identity politics, concepts such as safe spaces and trigger warnings, new gender pronouns, a political correctness that makes, for example, a furor over 'racist' Halloween costumes, out-of-control immigration, and the left's seeming inability to seriously address the issues of Islamism and Islamist terrorism.

I can't believe Americans rejected Hillary because she was a woman. The American author, philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris explains in one of his podcasts why he thinks Trump won the election. He blames the result to a large extent on American voters' reaction to, and their repudiation of, the left's analysis of the following issues: black/brown identity politics, concepts such as safe spaces and trigger warnings, new gender pronouns, a political correctness that makes, for example, a furor over 'racist' Halloween costumes, out-of-control immigration, and the left's seeming inability to seriously address the issues of Islamism and Islamist terrorism.

An agent of the CIA and the Pentagon, America's Great War Machine, he is most definitely. A dispute between China, Taiwan, Vietnam and others on the extent of their respective sovereignty in the S. China Sea dates back to end of WW2, but originated around 1900. It's been a century of on/off squabbles, their own affairs. But when Hillary became SoS a few years ago she proclaimed with great hubris Asia Pivot! What this means is the U.S. will install massive military forces in the region to contain & control China. And thus the Obama regime inserted itself into this century old affair, made it America's business, to cover the real goal of Asia domination. To meddle in this adventure and see what come out of it just like Syria. And if its war so much the better. The design is classic but most evil. Nobody like to be 'contained' and China responded. [I like to see America being 'contained' one day and enjoy to see how it jumps and cries like a bullied child.]The so-called Tribunal is not a UN-sponsored body. It is just an opinion body in a far away European country with absolutely no court power. It deals only with economic matters, not politics or border. Philippines previous president asked it to pass an opinion on the matter of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), not border or sovereignty. Specifically, what size of an island qualified for EEZ. The Tribunal reports that NO island or sandbar or reclaimed islands currently in the SCS qualify for EEZ. It also defined what size will qualify. That's it. No islands built or claimed by all parties - China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia is an EEZ and therefore not a basis for border. That's the opinion for this body. The meaning is simply that they can build bigger islands to fit the EEZ definition, or just go sit down and work out a border solution. China is willing to talk but not with the U.S. inserting itself in the matter. The new Philippine president agreed and they will begin the talk. Once they formed a framework others may join to effect a solution. This of course is very bad news for American war mongers and Asian Pivoters. What would they do without the excuse to insert even more massive forces than they currently have in the region, to ensure there is a Vietnam War 2.0 to match Cold War 2.0 in Europe?
