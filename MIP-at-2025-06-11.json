Would you want a President who denigrated a 12-year old girl who was repeatedly beaten and raped to get a client off?Would you want a President who said she would do anything and say anything to achieve her personal goals?Oh, and by the way who said publicly that she had two persona - a public one and a private one. Would you want President who deliberately ignored repeated requests from her diplomats in Benghazi for more protection? She left her people hung out to dry there. Would you want a President who sanctioned the downfall of two Middle East countries who were no threat to the U.S.A.?Theses countries are now threats to the U.S.A. as Libya is under the influence of ISIS and Egypt has moved into Russia's sphere of influence. Hillary wasn't doing this for women she was doing this for herself and no one else. So stop with the pedestal - she has feet of clay."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-10-11T23:22:57.332851Z","updated_at":"2025-03-19T20:40:11.867180Z","inner_id":12,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":4,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":13,"annotations":[{"id":514,"completed_by":4,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-01-25T03:24:16.800423Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T03:24:16.800506Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":18.539,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"27a15f8e-5cf1-45d9-b2b7-d41c01fde51a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":13,"project":2,"updated_by":4,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"86a375b1-hillary_13.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"As a lawyer, I have nothing but the highest respect for you, as a political writer, not so much.

What I did not like about Clinton the sense I got from her of 'entitlement', that the office was hers for the taking - and not just from her days as Secretary of State, or as a Senator, or from having been First Lady - it struck me, watching a documentary about the US presidential candidates that Clinton had her eyes set on 'the Office' from the time that she had been profiled in LIFE magazine at her College graduation. That uniquely American sense of 'Manifest Destiny' is not attractive - particularly when someone's asking for your help to achieve it. Now that's just my perception, but I believe that same arrogance was what led her (and her team) not to worry about the signals they'd received that they could lose votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Those states were lost by the thinnest of margins, and still, as it has been pointed out, Clinton won the popular vote. I felt that the 'feminist icon' trope was also odd, like a relic from a previous generation. I'm a man, working in a traditional male field (engineering) but I've always accepted and supported my female colleagues and managers. I will agree that the bemused tolerance of the masses was too easily interpreted as tacit approval of Trump's antics, until it was too late. I also agree that groups of people whose attitudes and behaviour sequestered them (rightfully) to an underclass in our society, have been emboldened. I doubt that they will remain that way for long. Nothing that Donald Trump can do will elevate these fools, or make their angry lives truly better. In much the same way, there was nothing that a Clinton victory would REALLY have done to make women's lives better - or guarantee them access to jobs that they would not have earned otherwise."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-10-11T23:22:57.332984Z","updated_at":"2025-02-01T06:36:57.080192Z","inner_id":14,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":4,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15,"annotations":[{"id":516,"completed_by":4,"result":[{"value":{"start":365,"end":371,"text":"left's","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"QrknLfJ5_a","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":636,"end":642,"text":"left's","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"GZy9xzoIQN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-01-25T03:37:29.094662Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T17:32:15.198435Z","draft_created_at":"2025-01-25T03:35:44.110719Z","lead_time":332.555,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bc5e1d17-278c-43fd-876a-170a48e5e33f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":15,"project":2,"updated_by":4,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7771fe68-hillary_15.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"But there have been many female leaders all around the world.

That said, Hillary Clinton DID win the popular vote. One of the biggest problems in America is the electoral college. Now, twice in recent history, two extremely qualified candidates have lost the election b\/c of the electoral college: Hillary Clinton & Al Gore. We need to let the people’s true voices be heard. We need to amend the constitution and abolish the electoral college. It was established by the founding fathers of America to ensure equal representation for each state, but it is now completely antiquated and detrimental to America. In fact, I can think of a few constitutional amendments that need to be abolished …starting with the 2nd amendment!!! (But, I digress)2) I somewhat agree with Herein when she writes, “She lost because she was a woman”. While I agree that it was one of the factors, I certainly did not vote for Hillary b\/c she was a woman and I hope no one else did either! I voted for Hillary b\/c I have the utmost respect for her 30 years of public service, her balanced thoughtful approach to making decisions and b\/c she is the most qualified candidate to have EVER run for the highest office in America! In fact, it frustrated me when Hillary kept referring to “the glass ceiling”. While I understand that it is not the case right now, every women should be judged on her merit alone….not the color of her pantsuit.

She could not successfully divorce herself from her very tainted history to represent the change that the clearly disenfranchised, or at least self-perceived disenfranchised, so desperately wanted."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-10-11T23:22:57.335076Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T17:45:11.270767Z","inner_id":44,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":4,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":45,"annotations":[{"id":536,"completed_by":4,"result":[{"value":{"start":193,"end":206,"text":"knife holders","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"o3xtua8Gmg","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":133,"end":137,"text":"high","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"Z1g3YrjTfo","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":151,"end":154,"text":"low","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"ccBvquiVcj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-01-25T04:25:51.765803Z","updated_at":"2025-02-01T06:48:01.836589Z","draft_created_at":"2025-01-25T04:25:40.292598Z","lead_time":53.186,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"30a9b877-1cd1-4422-9654-8ae7b2a31ced","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":45,"project":2,"updated_by":4,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"a6b446d8-hillary_45.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"I think Marie Heinen has misinterpreted the phrase Michelle Obama used in her outstanding speech about the value of women.

I'm going to tell my daughter what I told the two demoralized young female cashiers at the grocery store: That having watched Hillary's career for 20 years, having looked at her major donors (monied interests), having read some of the leaked emails, having looked at her positions regarding due process for accused men, having read accounts from former staff (from SS to aides to housekeepers) that she has a hair trigger temper and a habit of domestic violence and abuse of underlings, I would never have voted for her. Not in a million years. I'd have voted in Peewee Herman over her. I'm going to tell my daughter that having a vagina does not make someone a good person, that being a skilful rhetorician doesn't necessarily make what someone says valid, and that being diplomatic and a convincing liar doesn't make a person honest. I'm going to tell my daughter that being sad because a woman didn't get in this time is silly, and I'll point her to some genuine examples of women who achieved great things and never sacrificed their honor or principles to do so, and never had to play 'the vagina card'--people like Anne Cools, Erin Pizzey, Karen Decrow, and even Marie Henein. I'll tell my daughter that when Marie Herein spoke with Peter Mansbridge about her defence of Jian Ghomeshi, I watched the video ten times, transfixed by her adherence to the principles of law, of justice, of due process, of presumption of innocence, of the right to a vigorous defence, and her awareness of the power of the state to utterly destroy the lives of people, innocent or not, if it is allowed to act without constraint. And I'll tell her about all the feminist women who declared Marie Herein to be a 'traitor to her gender' for the crime of doing her job passionately and competently, and that it's this same mentality that has convinced some women that the results of this election are proof of misogyny. I don't care about whether Hillary's a good mother, or whether she held her grandbaby enough. I don't care about whether she's 'cuddly'. I care about her competency, her honesty and her integrity, and from more than 20 years of observing her actions, I found her lacking. She's a corrupt career politician who's in the pocket of monied interests, who has been irresponsible with classified information, whose inaction has led to deaths, and who only seems to be good at courting massive donations from foreign dictatorships and the banking elite, and commanding speaking fees in the hundreds of thousands, all while claiming to be the voice of ordinary American women. Oh wait, my daughter already knows all of this.

You name it, it may have given her enough votes to win. However, from my reading of it, being female had little to do with it. For my part I think its just as much a case of Obama failure as anything. That 'hope and change' really didn't materialize. But the US is highly divided. You can see that in the voting patterns of citizens initiatives. In Maine virtually every citizen initiative was divided almost fifty fifty. Want legal marijuana? Just barely over half do. A bond initiative for public transportation? DItto. Increased taxes for public education, 51%. Its not a coincidence that virtually every presidential election is decided within 8 percentage points, and thats no matter WHO runs. But I have to say, I do a lot of volunteer work, and most of the heavy lifting is done by women. From my experience, the next generation of women does not get its motivations or its role models from elections.

The NDP is reverting to its traditional role, which historically was to promote big-ticket social programs and hope they would gain sufficient public support to be adopted and enacted by the Liberal party. Much of Canada's social progress has relied on this dynamic. However, provincial governments are likely far more jaded at this stage. The cost-sharing model on which medicare was established, for instance, was fairly swiftly abandoned by the federal government, leaving provinces increasingly holding the bag for health care funding, which now eats up about fifty percent of provincial revenues in some jurisdictions. Even Martin's belated reforms, temporarily continued by Harper, barely restored a fraction of the funding losses the provinces have endured. Why would the province's agree to another bait-and-switch scheme?

An agent of the CIA and the Pentagon, America's Great War Machine, he is most definitely. A dispute between China, Taiwan, Vietnam and others on the extent of their respective sovereignty in the S. China Sea dates back to end of WW2, but originated around 1900. It's been a century of on\/off squabbles, their own affairs. But when Hillary became SoS a few years ago she proclaimed with great hubris Asia Pivot! What this means is the U.S. will install massive military forces in the region to contain & control China. And thus the Obama regime inserted itself into this century old affair, made it America's business, to cover the real goal of Asia domination. To meddle in this adventure and see what come out of it just like Syria. And if its war so much the better. The design is classic but most evil. Nobody like to be 'contained' and China responded. [I like to see America being 'contained' one day and enjoy to see how it jumps and cries like a bullied child.]The so-called Tribunal is not a UN-sponsored body. It is just an opinion body in a far away European country with absolutely no court power. It deals only with economic matters, not politics or border. Philippines previous president asked it to pass an opinion on the matter of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), not border or sovereignty. Specifically, what size of an island qualified for EEZ. The Tribunal reports that NO island or sandbar or reclaimed islands currently in the SCS qualify for EEZ. It also defined what size will qualify. That's it. No islands built or claimed by all parties - China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia is an EEZ and therefore not a basis for border. That's the opinion for this body. The meaning is simply that they can build bigger islands to fit the EEZ definition, or just go sit down and work out a border solution. China is willing to talk but not with the U.S. inserting itself in the matter. The new Philippine president agreed and they will begin the talk. Once they formed a framework others may join to effect a solution. This of course is very bad news for American war mongers and Asian Pivoters. What would they do without the excuse to insert even more massive forces than they currently have in the region, to ensure there is a Vietnam War 2.0 to match Cold War 2.0 in Europe?

So, in that respect, it is the perceived contrast between Francis and his predecessors that earns him the enthusiasm he encounters."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-12-18T20:19:55.018533Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T18:56:06.171043Z","inner_id":204,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":205,"annotations":[{"id":304,"completed_by":4,"result":[{"value":{"start":133,"end":138,"text":"stick","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"dZjRjH-UEK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":146,"end":150,"text":"craw","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"ZxdibgMK3g","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":337,"end":345,"text":"position","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"HgahtZAsko","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":289,"end":299,"text":"deviating ","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"pByWKN1xq4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":427,"end":437,"text":"deviating ","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"gZ-Y-FNvo8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":369,"end":379,"text":"recharging","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"7qnQDmGSVw","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":644,"end":649,"text":"focus","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"42_3oTd9be","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":925,"end":930,"text":"focus","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"UlxJtlx6oj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1083,"end":1088,"text":"roots","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"wTwb_cY8Zo","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1318,"end":1321,"text":"hot","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"xbkH2LmzUv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1378,"end":1387,"text":"embracing","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"sN87c89Dc3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":981,"end":989,"text":"focusing","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"2YK62uLxYt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":968,"end":976,"text":"material","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"eDbIZ8DsDP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":114,"end":121,"text":"liberal","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"Bg3K1YzgLA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-12-25T07:48:07.450350Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T10:00:09.153974Z","draft_created_at":"2024-12-25T07:47:09.300822Z","lead_time":348.10600000000005,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"e5511565-d23d-431a-8399-095c5634ad20","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":205,"project":2,"updated_by":4,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1b72c2f6-pope_3.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Ah, Ms. Wente is (1) a conservative and (2) I'm pretty sure wasn't raised a Catholic. The pope is expressing some liberal ideas that stick in her craw, fair enough. Personally, I think there's a number of things going on. Pope Francis is doing a great PR job for the church without really deviating from the Church's overall theological position. The church needs some recharging, and he's doing his best to provide it without deviating from core theology. He was a priest and bishop in South America, and saw a kind of poverty there that few popes (all Europeans, and until recently, all from Italy) have ever seen. Christianity - for all the focus the Church has placed on these things in the past few decades - was not meant to be about sexual orientation, abortion issues, and other modern day preoccupations. Its original imperative was about love and compassion, with a strong injunction to help the poor, as well as a focus on the life of the spirit versus the material. In focusing on poverty and questioning the rampant materialism of the modern age, he's going back to the roots of the religion (sadly mostly lost in the last 2000 years). As for environmentalism, why not? This I think is part of the great PR he's doing, there's nothing controversial about it from the Church's perspective, and it's a very hot topic these days. Whether he (or the Church) are really embracing it is anyone's guess."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-12-18T20:19:55.018609Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T10:00:12.659817Z","inner_id":205,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":4,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":206,"annotations":[{"id":991,"completed_by":4,"result":[{"value":{"start":29,"end":32,"text":"egg","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"-DPkrLv0Z4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-02-02T10:00:19.410764Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T10:00:19.410804Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.487,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"41729765-7456-4e9d-af37-df3d735400d8","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":206,"project":2,"updated_by":4,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"90bb7d94-pope_4.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"And

So it was very unlikely they would choose anyone who would rock the boat. I think people are confusing his sincere personal preferences for humility and a low key lifestyle and a warm personality for openess and liberality.

My personal experience living across the street from a reserve is that many of the problems are internal. I watched an 11 or 12 year old girl be sexually assaulted by an older male reserve member and when I called the police, they said they could only attend the reserve if someone on the reserve called.  So I stood there in the rain, yelling at the man who had assaulted the young girl and he told me to mind my own business and go away.  From my perspective, no amount of money will make the problem of abuse of young girls go away until the attitude on the reserves changes. Last week there was an article in the Globe titled 'The best native leader Canada never had.' It profiled Chief Clarence Louie of the Osoyoos band. Unless there has been no residential school abuse of his band, what is the difference between his band and all the other bands?  It seems it is a lack of leadership. Yes, I want this awful abuse to stop happening, but throwing more money at the problem doesn't seem to be the answer.  It has to be a change of culture within each individual band. I've met some really strong native women who know what needs to be done, but they are being undermined by a bad, sexist culture on the reserves. Tossing dollars at the problem won't help.

The stupid part is that my spouse and I let that police officer cart us around without protesting or making any attempt to escape! He first took us to 'the station' in the back seat of his police car so he could contact the relatives in Canada we named to arrange for plane tickets back (we arrived in Europe with one-way tickets and, after travelling throughout Europe and north Africa for two years, had run out of sufficient funds to buy them so we planned to work in England for awhile). The police officer next escorted us to the car dealership to divest us of our movable home, and then we were taken once more in the back seat of his police car, only to be dumped at the airport to await our flight for hours and hours, until tickets and departure were finally arranged.To this day, I do not know why we quietly acquiesced to his every demand and did not oppose him at all when we were doing nothing wrong and we were not even formally arrested! I suppose we were just frightened, intimidated tourists unaccustomed to criminal or legal trouble in a foreign country, but to this day I feel taken advantage of because I am aware of the cash value of the van.However, getting back to what I am saying - Belgian police have recently been extremely negligent in their jobs and there are many possible reasons for that negligence, one of which could be their attention being diverted with 'on the take' opportunities."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-01-23T04:35:29.249181Z","updated_at":"2025-03-03T20:31:33.633018Z","inner_id":333,"total_annotations":3,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":334,"annotations":[{"id":599,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"start":113,"end":125,"text":"accelerating","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"FF-RtMFixB","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-01-25T21:34:19.932755Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T21:34:19.932791Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":23.268,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"dc47a147-a15d-46f0-b36c-b934f8cf0107","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":334,"project":2,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"68fc556a-belgium_9.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"A large % of the population of Belgium is now Muslim.

At some point we need to wake up. This isn't about some segmented group that needs more cash thrown at it. They received all the benefits of modern welfare society and they still want to kill us. When it was some impoverished farmer in Afghanistan that hated us for drone striking his kids, I could get the left's argument that this drove him to radicalism. These aren't such people in Belgium. They are the people that have been given every possible opportunity by the West, and they still want to kill us due to the indoctrination they receive in their cultural centers and mosques. So I dismiss the author's view that these people are held against their will in some slum without benefits, simply not true. The author is correct that the political and security instability in Belgium allowed radicalism to grow unchecked, but it wasn't for a lack of welfare for these people. What is apparent is if the police are cracking down on radical preachers and community leaders, the terror sponsors will continue to find young men to carry out their acts regardless of the education, health care and money we give them.

But mutual defense DOES NOT mean we get dragged into it global wars of power and dominance. This is called the Pierre Trudeau Doctrine. The basis for Canada refusal to join in America war of ideology and hegemony in Vietnam, war of profit, power and religion in Iraq. Obama, a Nobel Peace Prize holder (but not winner), is responsible for initiating two potential global wars of the 21st century - new Cold War with Russia, War with China. It's all about power and profit. The Pentagon even commissioned a study by the Rand Corporation on how to fight a war with China, report just released. U.S. government sees China rise and activities in the S. China Sea as a direct challenge to its claimed global hegemony. There is some truth to it. American Navy currently can block all sea traffic on the Malacca Strait to chock off China. It has stationed forces in Singapore. China response to this threat is part of settling the borders on the South China Sea. A settlement to its favor is to enable China to defend the Malacca Strait blockage. If it works, America claim of global dominance will have a big limp cut off. Now what is Canada going to do with America challenge to our NWP sovereignty. Cry and beg? No, build a fleet of Arctic Offshore Patrol Boats, lightly armed, to act as surveillance and intruder trigger. There is only one force the U.S. empire mongers understand - Force.

Remember, Mr. Trump chewed his way through 16 other Republican contenders, most of them men, and probably all of them technically more qualified than he. Much of that spectacle occurred long before it was evident that Ms. Clinton would be the Democratic nominee. You assume, incorrectly, that America is a progressive society. While there are progressive segments, what this election demonstrated is the opposite.  Sexism, racism and xenophobia are alive and doing very well there, particlarly in the Republican caucus. Further, politics is relentlessly self-serving, at the personal and party level. Also, especially since 2008, economic growth has disproportionately benefitted the wealthy. (That's a big issue on its own, but its relevance here is that the privileged are making the economic and political decisions to their own benefit while the underclass is falling farther behind.) For example, how can America's election campaign funding model be considered fair and democratic?  Mr. Trump has ably exploited all these issues. Ms. Clinton, besides being a woman, also became the poster-person for the status quo. In effect her biggest asset - her vast experience - became a liability.  Perhaps Bernie Sanders would have been a better adversary, not because he's a guy, but because he also was speaking out about the injustices being suffered by less privileged Americans.  Those arguments worked very well for his popularity too, particularly among young women.  And, since we're here, Ms. Clinton wasn't so overwhelmingly popular among those younger women. While one can argue with some validity that some women are against a female President, I'd venture that for many of them, other issues are in play.While it is fair to speak out against sexism (and racism and xenophobia) in America and elsewhere, my worry now is that Americans have elected a sorcerer's apprentice. How much damage can this apprentice do?  I worry about increasing instability in eastern Europe (in particular).  I worry about war over the South China Sea.I worry that the global ecosphere is in deeper trouble now, due to Mr Trump's inappropriate policies on climate change, habitat destruction and unsustainable, profit-driven, wasteful consumption of resources.

So why has Canada been tasked with the responsibility as a safe haven for Chinese nationals, and their money, at the expense of Canadians, Canadian tax payers, and the quality of our lives?3) The Citizens of Vancouver and of Canada, in general, are what gives these properties their value. We are a fair and equal society where human rights and the rule of law rein. We are not bogged down by corruption, government suppression nor a vast indifference to each other. We have dialogue and free speech, open government and democratic institutions, and an enormous acceptance and healthy curiosity for what is different. Our behaviour gives these properties value! This country is not at war with another country nor itself. Why should the citizens who built and are building this country be put at a disadvantage, in terms of finance and quality of life, to accommodate those who have little to nothing to do with this city or country. Personally, I don't think my behaviour and my actions should put me at a disadvantage to promote the inability of Chinese nationals to reform their country.4) If a foreign entity eg. state, business, or individual were to impose their ideologies on another, or exacerbate the inequality in that country the term colonialism would be used to describe their actions. Then why shouldn't their be some means to correct this? 5) Unlike the Head-tax, this tax does not target any one nationality.

He makes NO mention of China's very restrictive land ownership policies, something that is done to protect real estate for domestic citizens ... and no one calls China 'racist' for doing that.  Even the Chinese Ambassador to Canada blamed Canada for not taking steps to control its domestic real estate market.I'm getting rather tired of the convenient use of the 'race lens' everywhere INSIDE Canada because it doesn't play very well elsewhere.  Canada is not perfect, but it is probably one of the least racist nations ... except when it comes to First Nations who tend to have been restricted by government decree until recent years.The following article from 2013 tells us that more than half of Toronto's population is NON-white (the target of authors who favour a 'race lens') -- same in Vancouver?: http:\/\/www.canadianbusiness.com\/blogs-and-comment\/a-fascinating-new-map-of-torontos-ethnic-distribution\/ It also identifies the primary source countries for immigration as the Philippines, India, and China.  What are the current populations of the primary source nations for Canadian immigrants? As of June 30, 2015, China had the largest population at 1.362 billion followed by India at 1.252 billion with the Philippines coming in at 100,699,000. Populations of various nations can be found at http:\/\/populationpyramid.net\/world\/2015\/   If we are going to talk about skin colour as if it is the DEFINING point for a nation, let’s be completely honest about the place of white skin (a 'trick' of melanin contained in all human skins) in the world.  White is the true minority colour in this global human mix.Canada receives large numbers of immigrants from homogeneous nations where being white is a rarity; yet, Canada is home to a very mixed population of 35,939,000. Within the context of world populations (particularly immigrant source nations), the number of 'white' people is miniscule. Many parts of Canada are trying to 'resemble' the populations of the entire world. Yet, NOWHERE ELSE in the world does that happen. Immigrant source nations are certainly NOT trying to resemble Canada, or attract ‘white’ people because they feel they MUST be more ‘diverse’, though 'Homo sapiens sapiens' simply describes the entire human race as ONE single species. What's up with the 'race lens' that is supposed to be applied uniquely and ONLY in Canada?

Third, the tax is not exclusive to Chinese as the head tax was. Although Chinese are most affected by the tax, there are plenty of American film and software workers moving here who are also affected. Last year was a record year for film and TV. Microsoft, EA Sports, Dreamworks and many others are big employers in Vancouver, and many are expanding.Finally, many other countries have similar restrictions or taxes - Switzerland and Thailand are two that come to mind. If the author thinks that this is racist, he should be calling out China. It has had nationwide restrictions since 2006, where foreigners can only own one property for personal use, and then only after living in the country for a year. There are also legislated restrictions on the ability of foreigners to get a mortgage.

The tone of the piece is self-congratulatory and questionably factual. Important facts are omitted or skewed in the interest of artificially supporting the author's point and logic fails.'Europe has failed the refugees'....really. Poor Greece has been inundated with refugees that can't afford to help. Germany accepted 140,000 refugees in 2015 (not just Syrian), Italy and Sweden 30,000 each, France 20,000. Small Denmark was swamped with 20,000 refugee applications. Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and even Egypt and Iraq have been helping the refugees since the beginning of the crisis (2011). For the most part they permitted Syrians access to their countries and have spent vast amounts of money to support them - some published numbers include Turkey, by the start of December 2014, spent USD 4.5 billion in direct assistance to Syrian and as of mid-2014, tiny Jordan and Lebanon had provided more than US$ 1.2 billion and 1.6 billion respectively.Many refugees are not interested in leaving the region. Millions want to return home once the war is over and would prefer to stay close to home - little interest was shown in immigrating to Canada when they were questioned last year.And as for complaints by the author that 'More than 1,000 of the newcomers are living in temporary housing. And we still have a shortage of family doctors, a lack of proper dental care for low-income adults and a lack of subsidized daycare spaces for parents who want to learn English'. How does that differ from the plight faced by many Canadians? Should refugees be somehow afforded a higher priority than citizens?And the comment 'University-age refugees, or those who already have foreign degrees, can't afford our postsecondary system, sending many to low-income jobs instead. What future do refugees have without proper language training, Canadian education or Canadian work experience' pretty much sums up why the refugees don't want to come to Canada or complain when they get here. Resettlement of refugees is a complex, time consuming undertaking and resource intensive. How is Canada supposed to magically change this experience? It is easy to put these complaints to paper but I see not solutions proposed - and that is the hard part."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-01-23T04:46:54.957572Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T05:43:03.434206Z","inner_id":704,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":705,"annotations":[{"id":864,"completed_by":5,"result":[{"value":{"start":248,"end":251,"text":"set","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"H9OZLLG_SC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":252,"end":256,"text":"foot","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"VHwU-RPZsZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16,"end":23,"text":"missing","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"JJ2ypGIrEE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":28,"end":33,"text":"point","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"XyFn1NJnwr","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":88,"end":93,"text":"flood","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"etZJ8whS4U","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-01-27T05:44:53.802125Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T05:44:53.802160Z","draft_created_at":"2025-01-27T05:44:13.973531Z","lead_time":94.018,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"15c860cd-1c7a-4e41-8ddc-fe4262efe50a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":705,"project":2,"updated_by":5,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"528ddde8-refugees_30.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"I think you are missing her point.

An earlier article referred to the new generation of refugees being born in birthing tents along the route to Europe -- parents aren't planning for the future of their own children when they continue to produce more and more of them as they move from crowded refugee camp to another. Rouba Al-Fattal should look at the huge increases in populations in the Middle East and take note of where most of the civil wars are taking place ... in nations where the population has tripled or quadrupled since the 1980s.  Huge numbers of people are fighting over territory, though they pretend it has something to do with religion.Nowhere on earth can millions of people cross an isthmus to existing host towns ... where they do not share the values of the hosts ... and demand to be taken in at the expense of the hosts. Demand housing, demand health & dental care, demand education, demand recognition for credentials at face value, demand childcare ... who is paying for all this? Hint: not the refugees.This is a smack in the face to all Canadians, particularly those who never thought it was a good idea to bring these huge families to Canada, preferring to send those funds (for flights to Canada and costly accommodation here) to refugee settlements in Jordan and other zones close to Syria.  Instead, we hear more and more demands without any recognition for all the associated costs.  Even Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States do NOT accept refugees, even though they are member states of the UN.I suspect it is this pushy demanding attitude that leads to problems in the Middle East, along with the unsustainable growth in population. Canada has a high unemployment rate and is the participant (usually the victim) in many free trade deals.  Globalization, modernization, outsourcing and sophisticated new technologies ensure Canada cannot support a forever growing population.

EditorsAt least this is a much more balanced piece than 'the sky is falling' piece you wrote the other day.Here's my view, sitting here in our homeland, not having a vote in the US.Full democracy, allows us all to do and say what we want (short of hatred and racism). My father and uncles, all went to war in WWII to protect that right for all of us today. Most people, in both Canada and the US, have family members who did the same, and some who made the ultimate sacrifice. That America exercised that right yesterday, and other democratic countries have done the same in the past (I am not a fan of Junior Trudeau) is our best strength. As Winston Churchill famously said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.”. None of us have an idea how a Trump Presidency will turn out; but the inescapable fact of the matter is that every American, who wanted to exercise their franchise, had the opportunity yesterday to decide who their President is. It wasn’t all that long ago (Aug 6, 1965), that a guy who many people might have expected wouldn’t support universal suffrage, Lyndon Baines Johnson, passed into law for the US, the Voting Rights Act. In 4 years, if they don’t like his performance, they get to kick Trump out of office. In the meantime, everyone who thinks they are “politically entitled” in the US has a chance to rebuild their favourite system. Just as Lech Walesa upset the communist system in Poland, so today has Donald Trump upset the system of political elites in the USA. This is healthy; this is growth; and this will keep America as the leader of the free world. For a country born of revolution, they have nothing to fear. God bless the United States of America. There couldn’t be a prouder moment to live there."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-01-23T04:49:43.143420Z","updated_at":"2025-03-09T07:17:04.572724Z","inner_id":762,"total_annotations":3,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":763,"annotations":[{"id":932,"completed_by":5,"result":[{"value":{"start":122,"end":126,"text":"sick","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"ox_x_SyEKm","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":346,"end":352,"text":"people","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"meta":{"text":["man of the people- idiom? if so, people is the M part"]},"id":"QrYIwZXYUX","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":377,"end":381,"text":"sway","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"cgnBMBEbEM","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":130,"end":139,"text":"back room","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"9a_vr3LMRm","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":573,"end":581,"text":"disliked","labels":["METAPHOR"]},"id":"8KSm8iZPST","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-01-31T22:57:41.765762Z","updated_at":"2025-02-10T05:23:26.464810Z","draft_created_at":"2025-01-31T22:53:41.454265Z","lead_time":746.668,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"4a04389e-2fd0-4291-a213-f88d9d16d86b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":763,"project":2,"updated_by":5,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"913ba497-trump_30.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Despite all media definitely being biased against Trump...he proved ALL MEDIA wrong!!!Why did he win?

J. Trump is now confirmed elected POTUS by overwhelming electoral votes majority. Also, Republican candidates have won BOTH Senate and House.

Given his style, he WILL do as he pleases. The Donald won despite having NO support from the entire political Establishment, NO support from Big Media, NO support from Big Money, NO support from the War Machine, NO this and NO that. His opponent used the most dirty of tricks, cast him as friend of 'evil' Putin, which he just smile. See, the Donald being the ultimate outsider knows a whole lot the big political machine that ran America for so long does not know. Chief among this is he is on his way to wipe out both the Democrat and Republican parties at the same time!The Donald ran a movement. Hillary ran a rig to construct a dynasty. In a movement it does not matter about the details. You just have to sound right and look right for the mob to follow. Hillary humiliating defeat is entirely by herself. Trump rise to power is completely the result of the failure of not only both parties but presidents since Reagan. One of whom is a war criminal under state protection. With both political parties wiped out, the first shot of the movement already yields a political revolution. The 'swamp' already half drained. His task now is to be a Revolutionary Leader. Turn everything upside down. He will do well to read up on such people in history. Such as George Washington, Napoleon, Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Mussolini, and yes Putin. Putin saved Russia.

A lot of the debate were not about addressing the real issues.  It was about elites trying to make themselves feel good by explaining how stupid and backwards people who wanted to leave are.  In the case of Trump, Michael Moore warned everyone by painting Trump as dangerous, and his fear was most vocalized when he warned his fellow progressives not to attack his followers but to show why Trump is just conning them.   Moore sees Trump's supporters as decent people who have legitimate problems that are not being addressed, and attacking them as backwards deplorable irredeemable was the worse strategy possible.But what did the progressives do?  They said only stupid racist hateful people support Trump.   It was almost like Trump successfully pulled off an Alinsky tactic by baiting the establishment progressives into overreacting and making his supporters even more convinced that he was going to blow the whole place up.I think Moore's plan was difficult to pull off because neither Hillary nor Moore or just about anyone else had the ability to connect to the rust belt and hurting 'deplorables' the same way Trump could --- it's all about people skills.Besides, there was no way Clinton could say that if Ford wanted to move their factory to mexico, she would slap a 35% tarriff when they ship the cars back to the US --- no way Wall Street could tolerate that.

Then Mr Trudeau needs to have the same conversation with the premiers. That doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of carbon taxes, but it certainly means making them genuinely revenue neutral. That means returning all the revenue to individuals and corporations  in the form of reduced taxes, including corporate taxes and regulatory costs, to maintain competitiveness.  That's what economists who proposed carbon taxes  originally had in mind, rather than treating carbon taxes as a big sin tax that goes into general revenues for addressing deficits and paying for pet projects, as our governments tend to regard them. Otherwise, we jeopardize Canadian competitiveness and prosperity. Arrogantly and contemptuously dismissing these concerns as not worthy of consideration in comparison to the fate of the earth or whatever will just increase the likelihood of Canada producing  its own Trump three or four years from now. For the long term, we need not only to defend the Canada-US free trade agreement, even if it is modified in some way, but to expand our trade connections with other countries. CETA is a good start. However it is also important to grow our own internal market. That means eliminating interprovincial barriers to trade in goods and services. Here Mr Trudeau needs to start knocking some provincial premier heads. And it means increasing Canada's population. The advantage of increased population, so long as it is a productive population that isn't just an overall drain on resources, is that it increases the internal market and makes it less susceptible to the inevitable vicissitudes of foreign trade and isolationist eruptions elsewhere. That's a great advantage the United States and Europe have and Canada lacks. Faced with a situation like Mr Trump's victory, Mr Chretien and Mr Martin would have sat down for some blunt conversations with members of their own party and provincial counterparts , as they did concerning the implications of the deficit for Canadian prosperity. Mr Trudeau needs to show he is made of the same stuff.

For those who thought Bush and Cheney were the worst thing to happen to America, they couldn't at that time foresee a Trump election. None of the snake-oil pitches made by him to fix the economy will come to pass, but he has succeeded in doing what might have seemed impossible only a few days ago. He has managed to make the world a much more dangerous place, while more then likely plunging the world into a recession.   When you make stupid decisions and they have no consequence it only matters to yourself. When you consciously vote in a man uniquely unqualified to be president , then those voters must also wear the stupid hat.

Boy should take Trump's election as a warning.

The lawsuit also challenges Uber’s practice of telling passengers that the gratuity is included and not to tip the drivers, even though you are not getting a tip!!We won a major victory on March 11, 2015, when the judge overseeing the case, Judge Edward M. Chen, of the federal district court in San Francisco, denied Uber’s motion for summary judgment!  In his decision, the judge agreed with many of our arguments about why Uber drivers may be properly classified as employees.  Click here to read the court’s decision.  Under the court’s order, the case will go to trial before a jury.  See the news stories below for reports on the ruling.The next step in the case will now be for the court to decide class certification, which would define the scope of the case and which drivers can be covered under it. The court has set a hearing on class certification for August 6, 2015.  We expect that Uber will argue that most drivers are bound by an arbitration clause, which prevents them from benefiting from a class action case in court.  In another case (which challenges Uber’s background checks), the same judge who is presiding over our case ruled that Uber’s arbitration clause is unconscionable and unenforceable.  However, Uber has appealed that decision.  In the event that the arbitration clause is ultimately enforced, we plan to file individual arbitration cases for drivers who may be bound by the arbitration clause. So if you did not opt out of Uber's arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting the agreement (and most drivers did not), please CONTACT US so that we can add you to our list of drivers to pursue individual arbitration if we need to do that, so that you can be assured of being covered by the result we obtain.  If you accepted an Uber contract within the last 30 days, you can still opt out of the arbitration clause by emailing optout@uber.com and saying you want to opt out of the arbitration clause.  IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN IF WE WIN THE CASE, YOU MAY NOT RECOVER ANYTHING FROM IT UNLESS YOU CONTACT US TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION.  SO PLEASE EMAIL ELIZABETH LOPEZ, AT elopez@llrlaw.com, TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION, IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEED TO FILE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS FOR DRIVERS.  MORE THAN A THOUSAND DRIVERS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED US TO JOIN OUR LIST.In a recent decision, the California Labor Commissioner ruled that an Uber driver was indeed an employee, not an independent contractor, and ordered Uber to reimburse the driver for her expenses.  This is the same remedy we are seeking for all Uber drivers in the class action lawsuit.  This decision was a great result and may be helpful to our lawsuit.  We were very pleased to learn that the California Labor Commissioner agrees that Uber is acting as an employer.  However, Uber has appealed the decision, which will be reviewed de novo in court, and so its impact on the class action case is not yet clear.We filed this case on behalf of Uber drivers across the country.  In an early ruling, the court agreed with us that the case could proceed on behalf of drivers nationwide.  In a later ruling, however, the judge changed his mind and limited the case to drivers in California. We think this decision was incorrect and we plan to appeal it. But meanwhile, if you have driven for Uber anywhere in the United States, and did not opt out of the arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting Uber’s licensing agreement, PLEASE CONTACT US to obtain a form to return to us so that we can pursue an individual arbitration claim for you, in the event that we have to pursue these claims individually, rather than through the class action.If you have any questions, feel free to call or email Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lead attorney representing the Uber drivers, or her paralegal assistant, Elizabeth Lopez, at (617) 994-5800, at elopez@llrlaw.com, or sliss@llrlaw.com.Attorney Liss-Riordan and her firm have represented thousands of tipped employees, and employees who have been misclassified as independent contractors, all around the country.

An orderly came by to check on me, and when he saw it he said 'That's really old school' (it's about 8 years old). And I - who remember when a Walkman was a marvel - thought how odd it was that something so relatively new and amazing was, just a few years later, almost obsolete.How obsolete? Well, Apple has stopped making them. Think about it: they made something that did just one thing and did it brilliantly, allowing users to store an incredible amount of music in a small portable device, but now that's gone, as they try to sell us on other gadgets that yes, will store music, but only a fraction of what the Classic could hold. Like Elizabeth Renzetti, I get by just fine with a Blackberry (for basic communication). I also wear a wristwatch (a Citizen Eco-Drive; never needs batteries), and for entertainment use my iPod Classic. When the Classic packs in I'll only be able to replace it with something that either a) holds a fraction of what the Classic can and\/or b) does a whole lot of other things I don't want or need.

Although my early years were spent starting the day with the Christian \"Lord's Prayer\" and celebrating \"Christmas,\" schools I later attended ceased any connection with any religion.
