What I did not like about Clinton the sense I got from her of 'entitlement', that the office was hers for the taking - and not just from her days as Secretary of State, or as a Senator, or from having been First Lady - it struck me, watching a documentary about the US presidential candidates that Clinton had her eyes set on 'the Office' from the time that she had been profiled in LIFE magazine at her College graduation. That uniquely American sense of 'Manifest Destiny' is not attractive - particularly when someone's asking for your help to achieve it. Now that's just my perception, but I believe that same arrogance was what led her (and her team) not to worry about the signals they'd received that they could lose votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Those states were lost by the thinnest of margins, and still, as it has been pointed out, Clinton won the popular vote. I felt that the 'feminist icon' trope was also odd, like a relic from a previous generation. I'm a man, working in a traditional male field (engineering) but I've always accepted and supported my female colleagues and managers. I will agree that the bemused tolerance of the masses was too easily interpreted as tacit approval of Trump's antics, until it was too late. I also agree that groups of people whose attitudes and behaviour sequestered them (rightfully) to an underclass in our society, have been emboldened. I doubt that they will remain that way for long. Nothing that Donald Trump can do will elevate these fools, or make their angry lives truly better. In much the same way, there was nothing that a Clinton victory would REALLY have done to make women's lives better - or guarantee them access to jobs that they would not have earned otherwise.","2024-11-06T03:34:31.455417Z"

found Trump's misogynous tripe repellant, I never gave it much weight in assessing Clinton's loss. What I did not like about Clinton the sense I got from her of 'entitlement', that the office was hers for the taking - and not just from her days as Secretary of State, or as a Senator, or from having been First Lady - it struck me, watching a documentary about the US presidential candidates that Clinton had her eyes set on 'the Office' from the time that she had been profiled in LIFE magazine at her College graduation. That uniquely American sense of 'Manifest Destiny' is not attractive - particularly when someone's asking for your help to achieve it. Now that's just my perception, but I believe that same arrogance was what led her (and her team) not to worry about the signals they'd received that they could lose votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Those states were lost by the thinnest of margins, and still, as it has been pointed out, Clinton won the popular vote. I felt that the 'feminist icon' trope was also odd, like a relic from a previous generation. I'm a man, working in a traditional male field (engineering) but I've always accepted and supported my female colleagues and managers. I will agree that the bemused tolerance of the masses was too easily interpreted as tacit approval of Trump's antics, until it was too late. I also agree that groups of people whose attitudes and behaviour sequestered them (rightfully) to an underclass in our society, have been emboldened. I doubt that they will remain that way for long. Nothing that Donald Trump can do will elevate these fools, or make their angry lives truly better. In much the same way, there was nothing that a Clinton victory would REALLY have done to make women's lives better - or guarantee them access to jobs that they would not have earned otherwise.","2024-11-05T20:31:45.214030Z"

I can't believe Americans rejected Hillary because she was a woman. The American author, philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris explains in one of his podcasts why he thinks Trump won the election. He blames the result to a large extent on American voters' reaction to, and their repudiation of, the left's analysis of the following issues: black/brown identity politics, concepts such as safe spaces and trigger warnings, new gender pronouns, a political correctness that makes, for example, a furor over 'racist' Halloween costumes, out-of-control immigration, and the left's seeming inability to seriously address the issues of Islamism and Islamist terrorism.

I can't believe Americans rejected Hillary because she was a woman. The American author, philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris explains in one of his podcasts why he thinks Trump won the election. He blames the result to a large extent on American voters' reaction to, and their repudiation of, the left's analysis of the following issues: black/brown identity politics, concepts such as safe spaces and trigger warnings, new gender pronouns, a political correctness that makes, for example, a furor over 'racist' Halloween costumes, out-of-control immigration, and the left's seeming inability to seriously address the issues of Islamism and Islamist terrorism.

Details will be revealed when Canada GEN Investment Corp., the entity that held the shares, reports its trade with securities regulators in the next several days, Canada said Monday in a statement.'With today's announcement, we have eliminated a market exposure for Canadian taxpayers and returned GM to private sector ownership, having supported its continued contribution to the Canadian economy,' said Joe Oliver, Canada's Minister of Finance.

We never believed the Government should be a shareholder of a private sector company for an indefinite period of time.'Canada and Ontario joined with the U.S. government in financing GM's bankruptcy-court restructuring.

China Sea dates back to end of WW2, but originated around 1900. It's been a century of on/off squabbles, their own affairs. But when Hillary became SoS a few years ago she proclaimed with great hubris Asia Pivot! What this means is the U.S. will install massive military forces in the region to contain & control China. And thus the Obama regime inserted itself into this century old affair, made it America's business, to cover the real goal of Asia domination.

It is just an opinion body in a far away European country with absolutely no court power. It deals only with economic matters, not politics or border. Philippines previous president asked it to pass an opinion on the matter of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), not border or sovereignty. Specifically, what size of an island qualified for EEZ. The Tribunal reports that NO island or sandbar or reclaimed islands currently in the SCS qualify for EEZ. It also defined what size will qualify. That's it. No islands built or claimed by all parties - China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia is an EEZ and therefore not a basis for border. That's the opinion for this body. The meaning is simply that they can build bigger islands to fit the EEZ definition, or just go sit down and work out a border solution. China is willing to talk but not with the U.S. inserting itself in the matter. The new Philippine president agreed and they will begin the talk. Once they formed a framework others may join to effect a solution. This of course is very bad news for American war mongers and Asian Pivoters.

Pope Francis is doing a great PR job for the church without really deviating from the Church's overall theological position. The church needs some recharging, and he's doing his best to provide it without deviating from core theology. He was a priest and bishop in South America, and saw a kind of poverty there that few popes (all Europeans, and until recently, all from Italy) have ever seen. Christianity - for all the focus the Church has placed on these things in the past few decades - was not meant to be about sexual orientation, abortion issues, and other modern day preoccupations. Its original imperative was about love and compassion, with a strong injunction to help the poor, as well as a focus on the life of the spirit versus the material. In focusing on poverty and questioning the rampant materialism of the modern age, he's going back to the roots of the religion (sadly mostly lost in the last 2000 years). As for environmentalism, why not? This I think is part of the great PR he's doing, there's nothing controversial about it from the Church's perspective, and it's a very hot topic these days.

It matters in a thousand different ways. Polarisation is driven by the deliberate exploitation of the long known weaknesses of first-past-the-post. That ground was prepared and the seeds were planted a long, long time before Donald Trump ever decided to run for office. He is merely an opportunist who jumped to the front of the line, in the right place, and at the right time......Perhaps the Globe will finally understand why electoral reform in general, and most particularly abolition of first-past-the-post, is the most urgent priority.","2025-01-16T23:05:29.253865Z"

Choices have consequences. At a time when the world is facing aggressive and highly motivated totalitarian powers, and enormous international challenges on climate change, ...... the US has just elected Wendell Wilkie and the America First ers instead of FDR....It takes a special level of wishful thinking to believe that the leaders of China and Russia, and a host of other unsavory despots, will not take advantage of this terrible error. This result is the outcome of thirty years, and more, of failure to defend the integrity of the institutions of democracy. It matters that Wyoming has the same power in the Senate as California. It matters that old-age mortality is a bigger threat to incumbent congressmen than the ballot box. It matters who sits on the Supreme Court and makes decisions on electoral spending, or on gerrymandered congressional boundaries, or on critical provisions of the Voting Rights Act. It matters that the fairness standard apply to all electioneering media. It matters that minority voters not have to stand two or three hours in line to vote, or that Greensboro N.C. not have its advanced polling stations cut from 18 to one.
